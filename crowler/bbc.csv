"Pope Francis to visit Canada for indigenous reconciliationPublished31 minutes agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage sourceGetty ImagesImage captionThe date for Pope Francis' visit to Canada has not been decidedPope Francis has agreed to visit Canada to assist with ongoing reconciliation efforts with indigenous groups the Vatican said on Wednesday.The trip follows disturbing revelations this spring about the indigenous children who died while attending residential schools.The Catholic Church was essential in the schools' founding and operation.The date of the papal visit has not yet been announced.The Pope has not issued a formal apology for the Church's role despite repeated calls by Canadians.In a short statement the Vatican said that the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops had invited the pope to make an apostolic trip to Canada ""also in the context of the long-standing pastoral process of reconciliation with indigenous peoples"".""His Holiness has indicated his willingness to visit the country on a date to be settled in due course"" the statement said.In Canada support for reconciliation - repairing the relationship between indigenous people non-indigenous people and the government - is at a recent high.The support comes after a series of unmarked burial sites were discovered in western Canada over the spring and summer most believed to belong to former students of residential schools.Between May and July more than 1100 burial sites were found. Some of the remains were believed to be of children as young as three.The landmark Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) report released in 2015 detailed sweeping failures in the care and safety of these children and complicity by the church and government.""Government church and school officials were well aware of these failures and their impact on student health"" the authors wrote.

""Having my records expunged will mean something to my grandchildren and great grandchildren. And it will mean something for other black children.""Speaking to a crowd of relatives and activists in Montgomery she said: ""I guess you can say that now I am no longer a juvenile delinquent.""CONTEXT:Before Rosa Parks there was a 15-year-old girlLONG READ:The black migrant who fought US segregationIn an interview with the BBC in 2018 Ms Colvin said she ""was not frightened but disappointed and angry"" because she knew she ""was sitting in the right seat"".She was the first person to be arrested for challenging Montgomery's bus segregation policies but her story remains relatively unknown. It was Rosa Parks who became one of the main figures of the civil rights movement after her case led to the boycott of the bus system.Ms Colvin said she had been inspired by the great anti-slavery campaigners Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth. She would end up testifying in the landmark case that effectively ended segregation on buses in 1956.Her lawyer said the probation had cast a shadow over her life. Ms Colvin left Alabama at the age of 20 and spent decades in New York but her family always worried what might happen when she went back for visits according to the Associated Press.Montgomery County District Attorney Daryl Bailey said he supported Ms Colvin's request.You may also find interesting:This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media captionHow do I talk to my children about race?Related TopicsAfrican-American Civil Rights MovementAlabamaUnited StatesBlack interest";Civil rights pioneer wants arrest record cleared;https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-59047634;mindset;0.930000
"Charlottesville: Why are the âUnite the Rightâ organisers on trial?By Bernd Debusmann JrBBC News WashingtonPublished1 hour agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage sourceGetty ImagesImage captionWhite supremacist Richard Spencer is among the defendants on trial for their role in the deadly 2017 'Unite the Right' rallyOver four years after a deadly far-right extremist rally in Virginia organisers of the event are facing a civil trial to determine whether they should be held responsible for the chaos that ensued.The ""Unite the Right"" rally that began on the night of 11 August 2017 in Charlottesville was seen as a defining moment in recent American history.An alleged neo-Nazi plowed into counter-protesters with his car killing one and injuring dozens of other.Now nine people injured in the violence are suing 24 of the organisers and promoters some of whom have gained notoriety as self-declared leaders of the ""alt-right"". Jury selection began on Monday and a trial is due to start as early as this week.Here's what we know.'A battle for the soul of America'Charlottesville attacker: I regret my actionsThe black man who took on the KlanWhat is the lawsuit about?The lawsuit alleges that the defendants ""conspired to plan promote and carry out the violent events"" that took place at the rally.""Defendants brought with them to Charlottesville the imagery of the Holocaust of slavery of Jim Crow and of fascism"" the lawsuit says. ""They also brought with them semi-automatic weapons pistols mace rods armour shields and torches.""Attorneys for the plaintiffs say they have collected more than 5.3 terabytes of evidence including social media posts and chat room exchanges from messaging platform Discord.The lawsuit invokes a 1871 law passed after the US Civil War which was originally intended to protect black Americans from the Ku Klux Klan following their emancipation from slavery.The law allows private citizens to sue others believed to have committed civil rights violations. The plaintiffs however must prove that the defendants conspired to do so and that injuries resulted.""That's just a testament to the fact that we have a situation in this country where people can credibly accuse others of committing the kind of act that Congress was worried about after the Civil War"" attorney Roberta Kaplan was quoted as saying by the Washington Post.The lawsuit is backed by a campaign group Integrity First for America.""The goal first and foremost is accountability for the defendants and justice for the plaintiffs and for the community in Charlottesville"" said the group's Executive Director Amy Spitalnick.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media captionThe statue of General Robert E Lee was towed away from Market Street Park CharlottesvilleWhat is the defence team saying?The defendants include prominent figures in America's white nationalist and far-right movement including Jason Kessler the rally's main organiser and Richard Spencer a white supremacist who famously coined the term ""alt-right"" and spoke at the event.Some of the defendants including Mr Spencer and ""the crying Nazi"" Christopher Cantwell - so nicknamed for a tearful YouTube video he posted in the aftermath of the rally - are representing themselves in court.Several of the defendants have also claimed that mentions of violence combat and weapons ahead of the event were referencing the possibility of having to defend themselves from counter-protesters.Some have said that their communications are protected by their constitutional rights.""You can say any nasty thing you want about any person or group you want and that is protected by the First Amendment"" Edward ReBrook IV an attorney for one of the defendants former Nationalist Socialist Movement leader Jeff Schoep told the Associated Press. ""That's not me saying that that's the Supreme Court.""Several of the defendants and their lawyers did not respond to the BBC's requests for comment.The plaintiffs have already received default judgements against seven of the defendants who refused to cooperate.What happened at the murder trial?The man who drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters at the Charlottesville rally James Alex Fields was sentenced to life in prison in June 2019.Four of the plaintiffs in the current lawsuit were injured in the incident which killed Heather Heyer 32.Image sourceGetty ImagesImage captionA street memorial in Charlottesville commemorated the death of Heather Heyer in the days after the rallyA self-described neo-Nazi from Ohio Fields pleaded guilty to 29 of 30 federal hate crimes as part of a deal with prosecutors who agreed to not seek the death penalty.At his sentencing in 2019 Fields apologised for the ""hurt and loss"" he caused at the Unite the Right event.""Every day I think about how things could have gone differently and how I regret my actions"" he said. ""I'm sorry.""In December 2018 Fields was also convicted of murder at the state level.How might this court case affect future rallies and protests?Advocates for the plaintiffs have explicitly said that they hope to bankrupt the Unite the Right organisers and send a message to other far-right extremists and white supremacists in the future.""A case like this can also have much broader impacts in making clear there will be very real consequences for violent extremism deterring others who are looking on and understanding those consequences"" said Integrity First's Ms Spitalnick.Mark Pitcavage a senior research fellow at the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism who has monitored far-right groups for decades told the BBC that the case ""has the potential to deal a blow to the white supremacist movement"".Mr Pitcavage said that many rally organisers and attendees already suffered consequences in the immediate aftermath of the rally.These consequences ranged from job losses and school expulsions after being publicly ""outed"" as white supremacists to legal consequences such as the current lawsuit and Mr Field's murder conviction.""The trial itself serves white supremacists as a reminder of what a debacle Charlottesville turned out to be"" Mr Pitcavage added. ""It's almost like a booster shot to the backlash in 2017 reminding everyone how badly that turned out for white supremacists.""How was Charlottesville a defining moment in US politics?Opponents of former US President Donald Trump often refer to the incident as one of the defining moments of his administration.At the time Mr Trump came under fire from both sides of the political spectrum for comments at a news conference. He said ""you had some very bad people in that group but you also had people that were very fine people on both sides"".

He hosted the first-ever Grammy Awards in 1959 and co-hosted the Academy Awards that same year.He was featured on the cover of Time Magazine in 1960 starred in several films and was a frequent guest host on Johnny Carson's The Tonight Show on NBC.Known for his trademark sweater and loafers - at a time when performers often wore tuxedos - Sahl would come on to stage carrying a newspaper with notes for his act written on it.He favoured story-telling rather than lounge-style stand-up punchlines.A comedic blunderbuss Sahl prided himself on poking fun at all sides often asking at shows: ""Is there anyone here I haven't offended?""""A conservative is someone who believes in reform"" he once said. ""But not now.""He also joked: ""Liberals are people who do the right things for the wrong reasons so they can feel good for 10 minutes.""RIP Mort Sahl.

After Kennedy was elected he turned to mocking him again.Following the Democrat's assassination Sahl's career took a downturn as he dedicated large portions of his shows to ridiculing the official account of Kennedy's death.But after the Watergate scandal in the early 1970s which led to the resignation of Richard Nixon his career picked up again. Sahl's opposition to the Vietnam War also brought him some new followers in the late 60s and early 70s.He continued to perform stand up into his 80s even after suffering a stroke.

"Covid vaccines: FDA panel approves Pfizer jabs for children 5 and upBy Sam CabralBBC News WashingtonPublished17 hours agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsCoronavirus pandemicImage sourceGetty ImagesPaediatric doctors could soon find themselves on the front lines of a US government plan to get some 28 million school-aged children in line for their coronavirus jabs.Advisory boards to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Tuesday decided that the benefits of jabbing children between five and 11 years old with the Pfizer vaccine outweigh any other health risks.The decision now awaits further approval from the full FDA and CDC. Both agencies are expected to follow the vaccine panel's recommendation.Data from the company's clinical trialsfoundthat a paediatric dose of the vaccine - one third of that given to adults and adolescents - was safe and 90% effective.If health officials approve the jab 15 million doses will go out to paediatric offices children's hospitals and pharmacies around the country.When could jabs for kids get final approval?Following the FDA independent advisory committee's green light on Tuesday the CDC is expected to follow suit on 2 November meaning jabs for five-year-olds could begin as soon as a day later.The Pfizer vaccine is already approved for American adults and adolescents but it has not yet been fully approved for most school-aged children.Among those between five and 11 years old there have been about 1.8 million Covid cases confirmed in the US according to the CDC. Fewer than two hundred have died and most of those had underlying medical conditions.Some medical experts say that given the persistence of the Delta variant and the return to in-person schooling vaccinating children is a crucial next step in fighting the pandemic.""Parents need to understand the urgency of vaccination because the pandemic is not over"" said Dr James Versalovic pathologist in chief at Texas Children's Hospital (TCH).Dr Versalovic estimates at least 1500 children have been diagnosed since the beginning of the pandemic with the virus at TCH the largest children's hospital in the US. ""No age group has been spared"" he said.What kind of opposition does it face?Vaccine hesitancy remains a challenge for US medical authorities. Uptake in the adult population has stalled below 60% over the past several months.Only a third of parents ina poll last month by the Kaiser Family Foundationsaid they would get their children vaccinated ""right away"". Another third said they would like to ""wait and see"".Some parents have expressed concern about hundreds of cases of myocarditis an inflammation of the heart muscle that have been reported predominantly in young adults who took the vaccine mostly after the second jab.Heart inflammation link to Pfizer and Moderna jabsDr Liz Mumper chief executive of the Rimland Center for Integrative Medicine thinks ""children should not be given treatments they do not need"" pointing to their low risk of contracting Covid and to the lack of long-term data on Covid vaccines.""I am opposed to rolling these vaccines out to all children in a one size fits all model"" she said. ""The vast majority of children already have mild cases.""In an interview with the BBC World News America programme an FDA advisory board member acknowledged it would be a tough decision to make.""It'll be somewhat hard. We'll be looking at data on several thousand children and then making decisions for millions of children"" said Dr Paul Offit.A legal immunity protection offered to drug companies during the Trump administration has also made it nearly impossible to sue drug manufacturers for any side affects suffered from vaccination until 2024.What would a rollout look like?The federal government has indicated that once the vaccine is approved it will ship paediatric doses to states almost immediately.Last week it announced plans to distribute the jabs via more than 25000 paediatric offices and 100 children's hospitals as well as through pharmacies school-based clinics and community health centres.The plan is designed to take into account that for this age group everything from dosing to counselling support from clinicians to the post-jab waiting period looks different than for other age groups and parents will need a trusted voice in the room.""It's one thing to have Dr Fauci on the national news say you should get your kid vaccinated but it's another thing for a trusted physician in the community to have that direct conversation with families"" says Amy Wimpey Knight president of the Children's Hospital Association.Long Covid in children 'nowhere near scale feared'Children's very low Covid risk confirmed by studyMass vaccination sites are not good settings for jabbing young children Ms Knight tells the BBC so state and local health officials will need to quickly link up with schools community centres and doctors' offices instead.""All plans are local.

Any side effects were ""easily treatable and monitored"" said Dr Versalovic.""We are fully confident in the paediatric Covid vaccines. It's been tailored to children"" he said referring to the reduced dosage.For a large provider like TCH ensuring adequate supply at multiple care locations will be of primary concern he said.At smaller paediatric practices physicians are a bit more circumspect.Dr Robert Dracker medical director of Summerwood Pediatrics in upstate New York warned that a vaccine rollout for kids will collide with other realities: the onset of flu season the mental health crisis of school children and staffing shortages.""Paediatricians' offices have been struggling terribly over the last few years"" he said.Dr Dracker says state health officials have set out guidelines and plan to dispense 300-dose allotments to his office.

They are expected to do that on 2 November meaning vaccinations could begin the very next day.The FDA's expert panel determined that the benefits of having the jab outweigh any other health risks.Company trial data submitted to regulators in September saidthe jabs produced a ""robust"" antibody immune responsein that age bracket.Children aged five to 11 are given a jab with a third of the dosage given to adults.Regulators however also had to weigh up the risk of heart inflammationa very rare side-effect of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.Covid map: Where are cases the highest?Paediatric doctors prepare for US child jab rolloutVaccinating children - how the UK comparesOfficial data from the US shows 160 children aged five to 11 have died of Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic. In total the country has recorded close to 740000 deaths from the virus.But millions have contracted the illness thousands of whom ended up in hospital. The US has also reported more than 5000 cases of a rare inflammatory disease linked to Covid infections which has killed 46 children.On Monday Moderna announced it would submit trial data to regulators after a study found its own Covid vaccine produced a ""robust neutralising antibody response"" in children aged six to 11.The UK has just begun to roll out jabs for children aged 12 to 15.The country's chief medical officers recommendone dose of a vaccine for children in that age group althoughapproaches differ in other countries.This is a landmark decision that could influence practice in other countries not just the US.Some nations like Israel have already intimated that they plan to follow suit.The US regulator has carefully weighed the pros and cons and says there is a case for vaccinating younger children against Covid.Although most children are unlikely to get seriously ill if they catch coronavirus they may still be infectious even with no symptoms.The vaccine could help stop them from spreading the virus to others.And some young children can still get sick with Covid.

Some remain on leave.Anita Anand is now in as national defence minister - the second woman to ever hold the position. The former academic was previously the minister in charge of leading Canada's procurement during the pandemic which included securing the country's supply of Covid-19 vaccines.The prime minister called Ms Anand ""a world class expert in governance"" who can help lead the necessary change in the culture of the armed forces.Another key change is bringing in climate campaigner-turned politician Steven Guilbeault as environment minister.Mr Trudeau has called addressing climate change a major priority saying that Canada will ""encourage challenge the world to do even more go even faster"" at the UN Climate Change Summit in Glasgow this month.What the COP26 climate summit could mean for us allMr Guilbeault had a rocky tenure as heritage minister when he introduced a broadcasting reform bill that was criticised as a threat to free speech online. He is a fierce opponent of oil pipeline projects a fact that could be an irritant for the country's energy producing regions.Mr Trudeau has also named his fifth foreign affairs minister since his Liberals first took power in 2015. Former official languages minister Melanie Joly has been promoted to that role.The ministers keeping their previous positions include Chrystia Freeland who stays on as federal finance minister and deputy prime minister.Canada's parliament returns on 22 November with a Throne Speech which is when a government outlines its policies and programmes as a parliamentary session begins.Related TopicsJustin TrudeauCanadaMore on this storyCanadian military leader resigns over golf gamePublished15 JuneTrudeau apologises to First Nation for holiday snubPublished18 OctoberPayout for indigenous Canadian children upheldPublished30 SeptemberCanada's Trudeau narrowly wins third term as PMPublished21 SeptemberThe numbers driving Canada's snap electionPublished14 September";Canadian PM Justin Trudeau shuffles cabinet;https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-59015485;mindset;0.930000

"Blue Origin: Jeff Bezos unveils plans for 'space business park'Published1 day agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage sourceBlue OriginImage captionAn artist's impression of the Orbital Reef space stationBlue Origin the space tourism company owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has announced plans to launch a commercial space station.Bosses said on Monday that they hope to operate the station named ""Orbital Reef"" by the end of the decade.Promotional material released by the company claims the station will be a ""mixed-use business park"" in space and will host up to 10 people.The company will partner with Sierra Space and Boeing to build the outpost.Blue Origin said the 32000 sq ft station would provide customers with an ideal location for ""film-making in microgravity"" or ""conducting cutting-edge research"" and said it would also include a ""space hotel"".At a press conference to launch the initiative executives from Blue Origin and Sierra Space declined to give an estimate of the building costs though the project seems assured of heavy funding from Mr Bezos who has committed to spending $1bn (Â£726m) a year on Blue Origin.The announcement comes as Nasa searches for proposals to replace the 20-year-old International Space Station (ISS). While funding for the station has been guaranteed until at least 2030 the outpost is indesperate need of repairs.Russian officials have previously warned that its cosmonautscould leave the station by 2025over fears outdated equipment could trigger a major incident.In response Nasa announced plans earlier this year to award $400m in private contracts to space companies to help the agency replace the ageing outpost.However there is likely to be stiff competition for the funding. Earlier this week a partnership between Nanoracks Voyager Space and Lockheed Martin announced its own plans to launch a space station into low orbit by 2027.Blue Origin has faced mixed fortunes so far this year. High-profile launches of its New Shepard rocket which saw Mr Bezos and Star Trek starWilliam Shatner blasted into spacegained significant media attention.But the company has also facedaccusations of sexual harassment in the workplaceand of turning a blind eye to serious safety concerns from former employees.Last month it missed out on a lucrative $2.9bn Nasa contract which went to billionaire Elon Musk's Space X one of Blue Origin's chief rivals in the commercial space race.You may also be interested in:This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media captionThe moment Jeff Bezos and crew launched into space on the first human flight of Blue Origin's New Shepard rocketRelated TopicsNasaBlue OriginJeff BezosInternational Space StationMore on this storyStar Trek's Shatner blasts into spacePublished13 OctoberSafety concerns raised at Bezos space companyPublished1 OctoberSpace station facing irreparable failures - RussiaPublished1 September";Jeff Bezos unveils plans for 'space business park';https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-59046076;mindset;0.930000
"The African tech firm hoping to power space missionsBy Elna SchutzBusiness reporter Cape Town South AfricaPublished1 day agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage sourceElna SchutzImage captionJonathan Lun wants to make satellites mobile""Most satellites are simply computers that are tossed out the side of a rocket [that] are tumbling in space"" says Jonathan Lun.Mr Lun and his Cape Town-based company Hypernova Space Technologies are keen to give these tumbling satellites a little bit more autonomy.The firm has developed a thruster system that could give even the smallest types of satellites the capacity to move around.The company is hopeful that their technology could be applied to nanosatellites which are small satellites weighing under 10kg and even applied to the tiniest of them all the 10cm cubesknown as cubesats.There are an estimated 3200 nanosatellites floating around in orbit already and that number is expected to grow rapidly in the near future: SpaceX alone isin the process of launchinga constellation of around 42000 satellites.But experts are concerned that this explosion in numbers may lead to problems.Without manoeuvrability - the capacity to change direction - nanosatellites risk colliding with each other causing space debris which might cause problems for other missions.Image sourceGetty ImagesImage captionA SpaceX rocket lifts off in May carrying the company's latest batch of nanosatellitesMobility would also make it much easier to retrieve or dispose of satellites once their working life was over.But as nanosatellites are deliberately designed to be small and cheap any new thruster technology needs to be simple to be commercially viable.Around a decade ago Mr Lun came across an interesting thruster technology that had previously been researched by Nasa but never fully pursued. He found that an electric reaction could be used to vaporise solid metal fuel a process which then created a jet of fast-moving plasma that could propel a satellite along.One big advantage to using solid fuels in this way would be that the material would be stable enough to add to a thruster-system prior to launch - removing the need for any last-minute fuelling before sending satellites off into space.""They don't have to worry about filling it up they don't have to worry about [the material] being toxic they don't have to worry about it during launch something breaking and leaking"" adds Stephen Tillemans the head of engineering at Hypernova.More Technology of BusinessHow to plug the UK into desert sunshineHow giant wind turbines are pushing the limitsEnergy from the fastest moving objects on earthWhy even huge ships can't fix the shipping crisisJust how hard is it to recycle a jumbo jet?Mr Tillemans confirms the company has successfully run several environmental tests such as running the thruster in a vacuum in extreme temperatures and with high vibration. Hypernova's first mission in space will be in early 2022 with EnduroSat a company based in Bulgaria.Together the companies are aiming to assess the performance of the thruster technology in space including measuring its force and demonstrating that it can successfully change the orbit of a satellite.Image sourceEndurosatImage captionAn illustration of the Hypernova system on a nanosatelliteHypernova are not alone in their research other organisations are also investing in developing the thruster technology that could propel small satellites through spaceincluding MIT in the US and the European Space Agency and itsHelicon Plasma Thruster.Hypernova is also collaborating with other players in the South African space industry such as the Electrical and Electronic Engineering department at Stellenbosch University which is currently developing a technology that would allow satellites to dock with each other.Image sourceESAImage captionThe European Space Agency is developing its own plasma thrusterLooking much further in to the future Mr Lun is confident that it would be possible to scale-up Hypernova's thruster technology so it could potentially be used for much bigger satellites and more ambitious missions.He is even hopeful that using metal as a fuel will facilitate bigger opportunities for the industry as a whole because thrusters could potentially be powered using substances found in space - both substances mined in-situ or collected from space debris for instance.""So if we can now switch over from rare expensive liquids and gases as fuel sources to move stuff around in space with cheap and abandoned iron ore or other metals it changes the game completely.""Related TopicsNasaEuropean Space AgencySpace exploration";The African tech firm hoping to power space missions;https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58724195;mindset;0.930000

He was executed in 1994.He often lured young men to his home for sex by pretending to be a police officer or promising them construction work.In reopening the investigation Sheriff Dart asked families of youngsters who had vanished between 1970 and Gacy's 1978 arrest to submit saliva samples to compare DNA with the eight victims who were buried without being identified.Image sourceGetty ImagesImage captionJohn Wayne Gacy killed 33 young men in the 1970sMonths later William George Bundy a 19-year-old construction worker was identified as a Gacy victim.In 2017James Byron Haakenson - a missing teenager from Minnesota - was named as another victim.Investigators matched DNA samples from Mr Alexander's mother and half-brother to his remains.Alexander's sister Carolyn Sanders thanked the sheriff's office for giving the family ""closure"".""It is hard even 45 years later to know the fate of our beloved Wayne. He was killed at the hands of a vile and evil man"" Ms Sanders said.""We can now lay to rest what happened and move forward by honouring Wayne.""Authorities say they are unsure how Mr Alexander crossed paths with Gacy one of America's most infamous serial killers.He had moved to Chicago where he was married for around three months before divorcing in 1975.In January 1976 he received a traffic ticket in Chicago. After this officers found no record of him being alive.Mr Alexander ""lived in an area that was frequented by Gacy and where other identified victims had previously lived"" the sheriff's office said.Police say their efforts to identify the other remains are ongoing.Related TopicsMissing peopleChicagoUnited StatesMore on this storyUS serial killer Gacy's teen victim namedPublished19 July 2017";US serial killer's victim identified after 45 years;https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-59040381;mindset;0.930000
"Tesla surpasses $1 trillion valuation after Hertz orderBy Daniel ThomasBusiness reporter BBC NewsPublished1 day agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage sourceGetty ImagesTesla surpassed a market value of $1 trillion on Monday making it the fifth such firm to reach the milestone.Shares in the electric carmaker climbed 12.6% after it struck a deal to sell 100000 vehicles to the car rental firm Hertz.Tesla has been the world's most valuable carmaker for some time but brands like Ford and GM make more cars.Previously only Apple Microsoft Amazon and Google-owner Alphabet have reached a $1tn valuation.For years Tesla struggled to ramp up production of its cars leading some investors to speculate it would fail.But last year the company led by billionaire Elon Musk upped its game and became profitable for the first time prompting its shares to take off.Following the jump in its share price Mr Musk's 23% stake in the business is worth around $230bn.The deal with Hertz is the biggest-ever rental car order for electric vehicles and seen as a further vote of confidence.Tesla withdraws self-driving beta after problemsTesla profit surge driven by record car deliveries'I'm just not ready to buy an electric car'Hertz will pay $4.2bn for 100000 Model 3s over the next 14 months which amounts to about a fifth of its fleet. The rental firm will also build a network of charging stations.Teslas have a range of about 350 miles per charge but there is a dearth of charging infrastructure in the US - something the Biden administration hopes to change.""Electric vehicles are now mainstream and we've only just begun to see rising global demand and interest"" said Hertz interim boss Mark Fields.Analysis:By Michelle Fleury New York business correspondentTesla has just won major bragging rights.Only a handful of American publicly traded companies have managed to achieve $1 trillion or more in market capitalisation and they are all technology companies.Think big names like Apple Microsoft Alphabet and Facebook. Amazon joined this elite club in January last year 23 years after becoming a public company.In comparison it took the electric carmaker headed by Elon Musk just 11 years.What makes Tesla's achievement all the more remarkable is that it is the first carmaker to hit this milestone.Tesla is now worth as much as the combined market cap of the nine largest carmakers around the world including automotive giants like Volkswagen and Toyota.Yet Tesla makes up less than 1% of global car sales.Elon Musk and company are being rewarded for anticipating the future direction of the industry.While Tesla may be a car company Wall Street treats it - and values it - like a tech company.Tesla produced around 500000 cars in 2020 - far lower than the likes of Volkswagen which made 9.3 million Toyota's 7.2 million vehicles and the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance which manufactured 6.8 million.Image sourceGetty ImagesImage captionTesla boss Elon Musk's 23% stake in the business is worth around $230bnHowever Mr Musk has set an annual sales growth target of 50% and eventually hopes to reach 20 million vehicles a year.On Monday it emerged that Tesla had withdrawn its latest update of Autopilot the ""full self-driving"" car software after drivers complained of problems.Some drivers reported intermittent issues such as safety alerts sounding despite no danger being present.The firm has not said when the driver assistance software will be re-released.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media captionWATCH: Security flaws found in home electric car chargersIn August the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened a formal safety probe into Autopilot system which is in 765000 US vehicles.The investigation follows a series of 11 crashes involving Tesla models and emergency vehicles since 2018.Related TopicsCompaniesCar TechnologyElon MuskTeslaElectric carsUnited StatesCar industryMore on this storyTesla withdraws self-driving beta after problemsPublished2 days agoTesla profit surge driven by record car deliveriesPublished26 July'I'm just not ready to buy an electric car'Published13 August";Tesla surpasses a $1 trillion valuation;https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59045100;mindset;0.930000

But he added that the meeting was secretly filmed and that he knew where two copies of the video recording were.Abdullah died at the age of 90 in 2015 and was succeeded by his half-brother Salman Mohammed bin Salman's father who named Mohammed bin Nayef as crown prince.In 2017 Mohammed bin Nayef was replaced as heir to the throne by Mohammed bin Salman. He also lost his role as interior minister and was reportedly placed under house arrestbefore being detained last year on unspecified charges.Mr Jabri fled to Canada after Mohammed bin Nayef was ousted.He said in the interview that he was warned by a friend in a Middle Eastern intelligence service that Mohammed bin Salman was sending a hit team to kill him in October 2018 just days after Saudi agents murdered the dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey.He alleged that a six-person team landed at an airport in Ottawa but were deported after customs found they were carrying ""suspicious equipment for DNA analysis"".Last yearMr Jabri accused the crown prince of attempted murderin a civil suit filed in a US federal court.The prince rejected the allegations.

The US ranks third with more than 410 million.But when breaking the figures down by doses per 100 people in countries with a population of at least one million Cuba the United Arab Emirates and Uruguay top the list.Most countries are prioritising the over-60s health workers and people who are clinically vulnerable.Some countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine.How fast is vaccination progress around the world?Where are cases still high?The number of daily cases is stable or falling in most regions except Europe.AsiaAsia which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020 has seen cases falling in recent weeks.In India where the number of new daily cases has fallen dramatically since May the official death toll is more than 450000 and it has recorded more than 34 million cases - second only to the US.Latin AmericaIn Latin America Brazil has recorded more than 21 million cases and more than 600000 deaths - the world's second highest official death toll.Mexico has seen the fourth highest number of deaths in the world with more than 280000.There have been nearly 200000 deaths in Peru which has seen the highest number of deaths by population size - more than 600 deaths for every 100000 people.EuropeSeveral European countries have seen a rise in cases recently driven by theDelta variantof the virus including Russia Romania Serbia Bulgaria and Ukraine.The UK has one of thehighest rates of covid infection in Europebut its relatively high level of vaccination has greatly reduced the number of hospitalisations and deaths.North AmericaThe US has recorded almost 45 million cases and over 720000 deaths - the highest figures in the world.The death rate in Canada is far lower than its neighbour's but it has recently seen a rise in the number of daily cases.Middle EastSeveral countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus.The official death toll in Iran - the Middle East's worst-hit country - has passed 120000 but confirmed case numbers are now falling.Israel has rolled out a highly successful vaccination programme. Cases are now falling after a recent spike in numbers.Daily cases in the West Bank and Gaza have also dropped after a sharp increase in recent days.AfricaAfrica has seen around 8.5 million cases and more than 215000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic in many African countries is not known as testing rates are low.South Africa with 2.9 million cases and around 90000 deaths is the worst affected country on the continent according to official figures.Morocco has recorded around 940000 cases and Tunisia is not far behind with around 710000.OceaniaAustralia and New Zealand have been praised for their response to the pandemic with both countries having seen comparatively few deaths.Australia has announced that it is toreopen its international borderfrom November restoring the freedom to travel to vaccinated citizens and relatives.New Zealand has also been in lockdown since mid-August though it is recording around 50 cases per day.How did coronavirus spread?Covid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan China in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020.It was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.A pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time.UK LOOK-UP:How many cases in your area?TESTING:What tests are available?SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them?VACCINE:How do I know the Covid vaccine is safe?About this dataThe data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.When comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way.This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.Other factors to consider include: different population sizes the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.The map table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for figures for France and the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University.

"Why is the Paris climate agreement important for COP26?By Helen BriggsScience correspondent BBC NewsPublished2 days agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsCOP26Image sourceGetty ImagesThe nations of the world are due to meet at the COP26 summit in Glasgow to try to agree far-reaching action on climate change.They're under pressure to improve on landmark commitments they made six years ago in Paris.What is the Paris Agreement?The Paris Agreement united almost all the world's nations - for the first time - in a single agreement on cutting the greenhouse gas emissions which are causing global warming.Adopted by nearly 200 countries in the French capital on 12 December 2015 it came into forceon 4 November 2016.A simple guide to climate changeWhat was agreed?To keep global temperatures ""well below"" 2.0C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times and ""pursuing efforts"" to limit temperature rises to 1.5CTo limit greenhouse gas emissions from human activity to the same levels that trees soil and oceans can absorb naturally (net zero) between 2050 and 2100Each country to set its own emission-reduction targets reviewed every five years to raise ambitionsRich countries to help poorer nations by providing ""climate finance"" to adapt to climate change and switch to renewable energyWhy is it so significant for COP26?Some of the key discussions in Glasgow will be about whether countries are doing what they promised in Paris.When it was signed governments admitted the targets set would not limit global warming to 1.5C.Because of this they agreed to update them by 2020 (when COP26 was originally supposed to take place).All countries should have submitted new targets for reducing emissions ahead of Glasgow but many have not come up with improved commitments and some major economies have no net zero target in place.What about promises to help poorer countries?The Paris Agreement restated a commitment made in 2009 that the world's richer countries should provide $100bn annually by 2020 to help developing nations deal with the effects of climate change and build greener economies.But in 2019 only $79.6bn was raised.What's morea recent expert report for the United Nationssaid the goal had still not been reached - even though a new and more ambitious target is supposed to be set for 2025.For many countries this is the biggest issue to resolve at COP26 - and the very poorest are demanding action.Climate change: Have countries kept their promises?Did the Paris Agreement go far enough?The plan is to create a climate-neutral world by the middle of the century.Becoming ""climate neutral"" means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible and compensating for any remaining emissions by removing them from the atmosphere using natural or artificial processes.But the average global temperature has already risen by about 1C.And scientists say the rollout of the agreement must be stepped up to have any chance of curbing dangerous climate change.They also say limiting the temperature rise to no more that 1.5C - rather than 2C - could:prevent small island states sinking beneath the waveshelp millions of people avoid the impacts of extreme weatherlimit the chances of an ice-free Arctic summerWhy did the US leave and then rejoin?President Trump said it was unfair countries such as India and China could use fossil fuels while the US had to curb its carbon.TheUS withdrew on 4 November 2020- by chance the day after Mr Trump lost the presidential election.But President Biden pledged to return the US to the Paris Agreement and make climate change a top priority. The US formallyrejoined the agreement on 19 February.Simple guide to climate changeWhat will climate change look like for you?How extreme weather is linked to climate changeFollow Helen onTwitter.Related TopicsCOP26Paris climate agreementClimate changeDonald TrumpJoe BidenMore on this storyUS formally withdraws from Paris climate agreementPublished4 November 2020World agrees landmark climate dealPublished13 December 2015";What is the Paris climate agreement?;https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-35073297;mindset;0.930000

"Lebanon: Beirut violence fuels fears of return to civil warBy Jim MuirVisiting Senior Fellow Middle East Centre LSEPublished14 hours agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage sourceEPAImage captionThe deadly fighting has heightened sectarian tensions in BeirutMy friend and neighbour Richard was starting a series of online meetings at his office on the south-east edge of Beirut when all hell suddenly broke loose.He spent the next three hours sheltering on the ground floor as the sounds of war raged around the building triggering a rush of traumatic memories for someone who had lived through 15 years of civil conflict from 1975 on.""All the memories of the civil war flashed back into my mind"" he said. ""It was very intense feelings of anger of fear of anxiety especially about my children. I felt that they will be living what I lived during the civil war.""When Richard later arrived home safely he suddenly burst into tears.""I don't know why and the next day I was not able to function at all. It seems the war trauma came back to me again. I didn't want this to happen to me and my children.""This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media captionWatch: People run for cover as gunfire sounds in BeirutFor Richard and many other Lebanese peoplethe sudden eruption of sectarian clashes in the capital on 14 Octoberrang strident alarm bells.Political tensions were very high the economy was collapsing electricity and fuel were almost non-existent prices were soaring - and now gunmen were battling it out in the streets again.Was the country teetering on the brink of another civil war?Sectarian fault lineOne of many reasons why the clashes had such resonance was the location. The Christian suburb of Ain al-Remmaneh on the south-east edge of Beirut was where the civil war began in April 1975 after a series of incidents culminated in the shooting-up by Christian militiamen of a busload of Palestinians killing more than 20.Image sourceGetty ImagesImage captionSyrian soldiers pictured in West Beirut during the Lebanese civil warFor the next 15 years Ain al-Remmaneh was on the front line of a mutating civil war confronting the adjacent largely Shia Muslim suburb of Chiyah.It was from Chiyah that a band of Shia protesters triggered the clashes on 14 October by rampaging into Ain al-Remmaneh chanting provocative sectarian slogans: ""Shia Shia Shia!""All seven of those killed in the ensuing gunfire were Shia including some from the Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement and the allied Amal faction.The incident triggered a virulent exchange of accusations and denials between the Hezbollah-led Shia alliance and the Christian Lebanese Forces (LF) party.Image sourceGetty ImagesImage captionThose killed on 14 October belonged to Hezbollah and AmalHezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah accused the LF of sending snipers to fire from rooftops in an attempt to kindle a civil war into which he said Hezbollah would not be drawn.He warned that he could command 100000 fighters with the implication that he could trounce his opponents if he had to.The LF leader Samir Geagea retorted that his party did not have a militia and was not seeking war. He accused Hezbollah of trying to cover up involvement in the massive explosion at Beirut port in August last year by pushing for the dismissal of the investigating judge - the issue that prompted the Shia demonstration.Foreign forcesBack in 1975 few observers predicted that a full-scale civil war was about to erupt. And once it did few of us imagined that it would go on in different forms for 15 years creating fault lines which are clearly still there today.So protestations of innocent intentions and even objective assessments of balances of power do not necessarily mean it might not happen again. When political deadlock is intense miscalculations can be made. Once blood is shed conflict can take on a life of its own especially in a situation of sectarian animosity.Image sourceReutersImage captionShia militiamen turned on snipers with gunfire and rocket-propelled grenadesPolitical confrontation and polarisation are already there. During the Ain al-Remmaneh clashes Sunnis in nearby areas and Christians in East Beirut's Ashrafieh district were on alert fearing another ""7th of May"" - the day in 2008 when Hezbollah fighters invaded West Beirut to crush Sunni and Druze opponents.""If the clashes had involved Sunnis rather than Christians trouble would have erupted all over the country within an hour"" said a well-placed Sunni military source indicating that Sunnis are nursing a virulent grudge against Hezbollah. ""People have had it up to their necks and a clash with Hezbollah would have been the last straw.""""I don't see a civil war tomorrow morning it will take time but it will erupt with time"" said a veteran politician. ""There will be more incidents... this is how it started in 1975. How can you stop it?""There was a geopolitical engine driving the conflict in 1975 and there is another one now.Then the right-wing Christian factions (which later morphed into the LF) were set on destroying the power of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) and the state within a state it had established.They were unable to do so on their own so they drew in first Syria (1976) and then Israel to help culminating in the 1982 Israeli invasion which drove out Yasser Arafat and the PLO.Now the LF are facing another state within the state this time run by Hezbollah. It was the only faction allowed to retain arms after the Taif peace agreement of 1989 which brought a halt to the civil war because of its role as a ""defender of Lebanon against Israel"".Since then it has built up a formidable and secretive military capability reckoned to be much stronger than the Lebanese army as well as a big network of social services hospitals and other structures.Image sourceEPAImage captionAn anti-Hezbollah demonstration in Beirut in the wake of the deadly fightingThe difference with the PLO is that Hezbollah is Lebanese. But its affiliation with Iran - it is widely seen as an Iranian proxy - lends a strong geopolitical dimension to any potential conflict.""The Iranians and Americans are fighting one another in Lebanon and in Iraq and in Yemen"" said a political source. ""You have to see the big picture.""While Hezbollah is deeply engaged with Iran there is a widely-held if undocumented belief that the LF leader Samir Geagea is receiving substantial funding from Iran's regional rival Saudi Arabia.Cost of warOne factor arguing against a major flare-up is the obvious imbalance of power underlined by Hassan Nasrallah's unneeded reminder to Samir Geagea that he could marshal 100000 fighters.Everybody knows that Hezbollah could fight its way into every corner of the country in a matter of days.Who are Hezbollah?But that would be to embroil the movement in a running domestic war without end one that would see it facing not only Samir Geagea's LF but also the Sunnis and perhaps the Druze.Image sourceEPAImage captionHezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah accused Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces of seeking to ignite a civil warInvading Christian areas would destroy Hezbollah's alliance with Samir Geagea's Christian rivals the Free Patriotic Movement of President Michel Aoun and his powerful son-in-law Gebran Bassil leaving it dangerously exposed.That alliance is already under strain because of Hezbollah's opposition tothe investigation of the port explosion of August 2020 the victims of which were mainly Christian.The Ain al-Remmaneh clashes have already had the effect of enhancing Samir Geagea's standing in the Christian community according to many Christian sources and even among some Sunnis.But by aggravating sectarian tensions and reinforcing mental and physical boundaries they were also seen as serving the leaderships on both sides rallying the faithful in the run-up to early parliamentary elections set for 27 March.Lebanon's economic collapse heavily blamed on the greed and corruption of the political class had brought leaders into public disrepute across the board with Hezbollah no exception.""There is no solution in Lebanon involving elimination of Hezbollah except by a full war which the Lebanese cannot undertake"" said a Christian veteran of the civil war.""Hezbollah is there and we have to live with it. The best bet is to fully empower the Lebanese Army and strengthen opposition to Hezbollah in parliament. They have to adapt to a political compromise.""That is a tall order. In the meantime the best the Lebanese can hope for is that the predicted future incidents will be contained and living conditions perhaps slightly improved by the fragile new government.The worst does not bear thinking about.Jim Muir moved to Lebanon in January 1975 and covered the civil war there from the beginning much of the time as a BBC Middle East correspondent.Related TopicsHezbollahLebanonBeirutMore on this storyWhy tensions in Beirut spilled over into deadly violencePublished14 OctoberBloodshed in Beirut as gunfire erupts at protestPublished14 OctoberLebanon country profilePublished14 September";Beirut violence fuels fears of return to civil war;https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-59035123;mindset;0.930000

If anything happens we will know.""Ramadan Abedi and his wife Samia Tabbal are suspects in the case. They have not been charged with an offence in the UK.The pair left the UK for Libya in April 2017 a month before the attack.Ramadan was detained in Tripoli two days after the attack but later released.A senior MI5 officer told the Manchester Arena Inquiry on Mondaythat he was ""likely"" to have influenced his son's extremist beliefs. In the past he has denied having links with Islamist militant groups or having any knowledge of the attack.His fingerprints were found inside a car used by Salman Abedi and his brother Hashem to store explosives and bomb-making material.Twenty-two people were killed and hundreds more injured when Salman Abedi detonated a bomb at the end of an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May 2017.Manchester attack: The victimsThe road to the Manchester Arena bombingArena bomber's brother is a coward families sayAs bereaved parents in Manchester keep searching for answers and for justice here in Tripoli the bombers' parents are keeping a low profile.BBC news has confirmed they still come and go from the family home on the outskirts of Tripoli sometimes staying for a few days sometimes for a week.The two-storey house sits behind a breeze block wall down a rough side road. When we visited the house the tall metal gates were chained shut.The only thing visible inside was an upturned wheelbarrow in the front yard. But a neighbour - who did not want to be identified - told us that Mr Abedi and his wife had been at the house just days before.Image captionThe Abedi family home is on the outskirts of TripoliThe couple have refused to engage with the Manchester Arena inquiry as has their oldest son Ismail.He managed to fly out of the UK on 29 August evading a scheduled appearance. He missed a flight the day before having been delayed by questioning from the police.Since then his whereabouts are unconfirmed but there is speculation he may have come to Libya where he has an extended family network.Libya's foreign minister Najla El-Mangoush - who is British born herself - told the BBC authorities in Libya and in Britain are in contact on this issue.""I think there is collaboration between the general attorney office and some figures in England related to this issue"" she said.""I am not sure if there is any positive outcome. We respect the judicial system and we don't want to interfere but also we are willing to collaborate from a political perspective if there is anything we can do from our side.""Officials in Libya are keen to stress their willingness to co-operate with requests for help from Britain - if they receive any. Asked if she was aware of any requests for assistance with other possible suspects who might be in Libya the minister replied ""not recently"".Libya extradited the bomber's brother Hashem Abedi in 2019.

It is the second time Mr Ratcliffe has used the tactic after a 15-day hunger strike outside the Iranian embassy in London in 2019.""Two years ago I went on hunger strike in front of the Iranian embassy on the eve of Boris Johnson taking over as prime minister"" said Mr Ratcliffein a statement online.""We are now giving the UK government the same treatment. In truth I never expected to have to do a hunger strike twice. It is not a normal act. It seems extraordinary the need to adopt the same tactics to persuade government here to cut through the accountability gap.""He said that although Iran remained the main country responsible ""the UK is also letting us down"".""It is increasingly clear that Nazanin's case could have been solved many months ago - but for other diplomatic agendas. The PM needs to take responsibility for that.""Image sourceFAMILY HANDOUTImage captionNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe after she was released from house arrest in Tehran in March 2021He added: ""It can be difficult to capture the feeling of a life wasting away watching prison creep closer while we sit in the PM's in-tray.""Mr Ratcliffe said he was making four demands from Mr Johnson including recognising Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe as a hostage and for the UK to push for an end to hostage-taking when negotiating the Iran nuclear deal.He also called for the government to pay the Â£400m debt that the UK owes Irandating back from a deal between the two sides over tanksin the 1970s.Mr Ratcliffe believes his wife has been imprisoned as leverage for the debt.He spoke to the new Foreign Secretary Liz Truss earlier this month but said he was told the government's response was to do nothing yet until Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was returned to prison.""For us reimprisonment is too late it would mean not seeing Nazanin until 2023"" he said.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media captionRichard Ratcliffe: Nazanin speaks to her daughter most days while under house arrest in IranThe MP Tulip Siddiq - who represents the constituency where the Zaghari-Ratcliffes live - called on the government to listen to Mr Ratcliffe.""It breaks my heart that my constituent Richard Ratcliffe has once again been forced to go on hunger strike to protest against the government's failure to free Nazanin"" she said.""It should never have come to this. It's time for the government to listen to the demands of Nazanin's family including paying the debt we owe to Iran and finally bring her home.""And the boss of charity Amnesty International called the situation ""incredibly upsetting"".""Like Richard we've grown tired of hearing ministers saying they're 'doing all they can' for Nazanin and other arbitrarily-detained Britons in Iran - it doesn't look like that to us and it certainly hasn't produced results"" said Sacha Deshmukh.He demanded the government sets out a strategy for getting Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe home and added: ""We call on Boris Johnson Liz Truss and other ministers to take the time to come out of their offices to visit Richard at his tent. Ministers need to hear first-hand how desperate this situation is.""On Sunday a Foreign Office spokesperson said: ""Iran's decision to proceed with these baseless charges against Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is an appalling continuation of the cruel ordeal she is going through.""Instead of threatening to return Nazanin to prison Iran must release her permanently so she can return home.""We are doing all we can to help Nazanin get home to her young daughter and family and we will continue to press Iran on this point.""Related TopicsUK governmentUK-Iran relationsForeign Commonwealth and Development OfficeIranNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe caseMore on this storyNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe loses Iran appealPublished16 OctoberUK and Iran in talks over Â£400m debt - ministerPublished3 MayNazanin husband talks to Truss about detained wifePublished19 September";Zaghari-Ratcliffe husband begins new hunger strike;https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-59030936;mindset;0.930000
"Iran: The painful choices of being pregnant and unmarriedBy Sarbas NazariBBC NewsPublished3 days agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage sourceGetty ImagesImage captionCouples who have children out of wedlock in Iran cannot have joint custody""I had to get rid of our unborn baby. It was the toughest decision of my entire life"" says Mitra a 27-year-old interior designer living in Tehran with her partner.Mitra and Mohsen a 32-year-old doctor moved in together underan arrangement known as a ""white marriage""- a form of cohabitation between a man and a woman which like sex before marriage is illegal under Iran's strict Islamic laws.""Mohsen and I understood the challenges in advance but had no plans [to conceive] back then"" Mitra adds.They eventually had a change of heart and hoped that they would be able to navigate the legal labyrinth to obtain a birth certificate for their unborn child. Despite their best efforts they were pushed towards an abortion.Article 1167 of Iran's civil code which declares that ""a child born of adultery shall not belong to the adulterer"" means that unmarried parents have no custody rights as a couple and only the mother can request for her name alone to be listed on the child's birth certificate.As for the child the authorities keep a confidential record of those born in such circumstances - information which can prevent them from obtaining certain jobs in the future.While there is no official figure for white marriage relationships they are increasingly common and have become a thorn in the side of the hardline establishment.And having failed to curtail them alarmed officials are now having to wrestle with the dilemma of what to do with the children of cohabiting couples.""At the end of the day those children will need to receive their birth certificates before being enrolled at schools"" Deputy Minister of Youth Affairs Mohammad Mehdi Tondgouyan recently told Ilna news agency warning that the consequences of failing to address the issue could be disastrous.'We are not giving in'Although they are aware of the issue of children conceived in white marriages few among Iran's elites have spoken about it publicly.Outspoken reformist former lawmaker Parvaneh Salahshouri sounded the alarm last September when she warned that abortion was the only choice for cohabiting women who got pregnant.But Ms Salahshouri was subjected to ferocious criticism from the ultraconservative Fars news agency over her ""unfounded claims"".Iran's establishment argues that economic challenges and complicated pre-marriage rituals are pushing single Iranians away from conventional religiously-approved marriages.It has gone the extra mile to encourage the younger generation into such unions offering interest-free loans to help with the initial costs.Image sourceBorna NewsImage captionFormer MP Parvaneh Salahshouri warned abortion was the only option for pregnant unmarried women""That is just a painkiller"" says 31-year-old Shina from the western city of Hamedan.""How about the neck-breaking rents?"" she notes referring to a housing market that has seen prices skyrocket in the past few years.Shina has been with her partner Sadegh for a decade and sees cohabitation as a trending form of rebellion against authorities in the Islamic Republic.""We are not giving in to such a forced arrangement [of marriage]"" she says. ""How is it that refusal to exchange a few vows suddenly renders our relationship illegitimate?""Evidence of the popularity of cohabitation is clearly visible on Iran's vibrant social media platforms - also a sign that the social stigma is fading away.A plethora of channels on the Telegram messaging app are serving as places for single Iranians to search for a partner. One channel has more than 45000 subscribers who share their personal data in the hope of finding a match.Still the fate of such virtual communities is hanging in the balance because of opposition among Iran's hardliners.Image sourceGetty ImagesImage captionHardline cleric Ebrahim Raisi was elected as Iran's new president earlier this yearTheir grip on power was tightened earlier this year following the election as president of the ultraconservative cleric Ebrahim Raisi.Only two weeks ago he ordered Iran's top internet supervisory body to prioritise the ""health and security"" of cyberspace - an indication that stricter controls could be in store.'Our dreams were crushed'For Shina and Sadegh the current restrictions had a high cost.The couple applied for a German visa when Shina became pregnant in 2016 knowing the legal problems they and their child would face. However they were turned down.""Our dreams were crushed and abortion was the [only] choice"" Shina recalls.Abortion is illegal in Iran unless the pregnancy poses a risk to the woman's life or the foetus has severe physical deformities. Because of those restrictions the abortion pill is not available on the market andmany women are forced to seek illegal terminations that can be unsafe.Image sourceGetty ImagesImage captionIran is incentivising young people to choose religiously-approved marriagesOne 36-year-old obstetrician who wishes to remain anonymous for security reasons says she has conducted three illegal abortions for cohabiting couples at her private clinic west of Tehran.For those couples with the means leaving Iran is an option.Pari and her partner Yassin who are both 35 spent all their savings on buying a flat in the Turkish city of Istanbul which has become a popular destination for many Iranians disillusioned by their country's economic meltdown and the stifling social and political environments.""When I had my very first morning sickness I decided that I would keep the baby this time regardless of the price"" says Pari who had an abortion after a previous pregnancy.""Leaving behind our homeland was never easy. But we will be raising the child born out of our love and that's what matters"" she declares proudly.""Still I cannot stop thinking of the cohabiting friends of mine who are longing to have a baby and are being deprived of the chance.""Related TopicsMarriageIran";The painful choices of Iran's unmarried parents;https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-58957045;mindset;0.930000

His experience of evading capture behind enemy lines saw him recruited into the Special Operations Executive (SOE) which ran missions to support the French Resistance.In the months which followed the D-Day landings he operated hundreds of miles into German occupied territory helping to disrupt train lines and enemy positions.""After the war it was a natural progression for Henry to move from SOE and the Army to becoming an MI6 spy"" said Mr Lewis""Initially he probably worked to counter the activities of Russian agents at the Hague in Holland and in trying to influence his Dutch military contacts against sending troops to the Pacific in response to a territorial dispute in that area.""Although much of his post-war file is still classified it is known that he then operated out of Palestine around the time of the formation of Israel in the late 1940s before moving on to Iraq in 1959.However something happened to him in Baghdad which radically altered Henry's world view.Image sourceCoombe-Tennant familyImage captionHenry's family were friends with Prime Minister David Lloyd GeorgeA mission from GodHaving been agnostic most of his life Henry joined the Catholic church when he returned to Britain in 1960 becoming a Benedictine monk at Downside Abbey near Bath.""All his files are still under lock and key in the MI6 archives"" added Mr Lewis.""He did give a talk in 1965 where in his lecture notes he said that in the Baghdad of 1959 he underwent physical and mental suffering which led to him taking up holy orders.""Had he been detained and maybe tortured by the Iraqi police force or the agents of another country? Russia was very active in Iraq at that time - sadly we simply don't know.""Although Henry was an active monk until his death in 1989 he never spoke again about his life as a spy.It will be another 40 years until his file is declassified when we may finally know for certain what else happened to Henry Coombe-Tennant.It was nevertheless a truly remarkable life.Related TopicsPort TennantGermanySwanseaMI6IraqJames BondWorld War TwoMore on this storyThe place Lemmy Santa & 007 want to bePublished7 May 2019James Bond film studio comes to cityPublished17 February 2014AM happy for James Bond Senedd filmingPublished2 August 2016Assembly no go for James Bond shootPublished12 March 2015James Bond backlash for assemblyPublished13 March 2015";What made this spy want to become a monk?;https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-59010672;mindset;0.930000
"Saudi Arabia commits to net zero emissions by 2060Published4 days agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsCOP26Image sourceReutersImage captionCrown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman made the announcement in RiyadhThe world's biggest oil exporter Saudi Arabia has pledged to cut its carbon emissions to net zero by 2060.Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the Gulf state would invest more than $180bn (Â£130bn) to reach the goal.But he said the kingdom would continue to produce oil for decades to come.The announcement comes days before the COP26 climate change summit at which world leaders will be pressed on their plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions and thereby reduce global warming.A really simple guide to climate changeSaudi Arabia now joins more than 100 countries that have committed to reaching net-zero emissions.Net zero means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.It is achieved by a combination of cutting emissions as much as possible - mainly by reducing gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) which are released in the use of fossil fuels - and so-called offsetting measures such as planting trees and carbon-capture technology.Net zero explainedWhile China and Russia have plans to reach net zero by 2060 other countries - including the US the UK and Saudi Arabia's neighbour the United Arab Emirates another major oil producer aim to achieve the goal 10 years earlier.Saudi Arabia's move does mark a shift for the world's 10th-largest emitter of carbon dioxide. It has long resisted calls to cut its investment in fossil fuels.This week documents leaked to the BBC revealedSaudi officials asked the UN to play down the need to rapidly move away from fossil fuels ahead of the COP26 meeting which starts in Glasgow on 31 October.At the launch of a climate conference in Riyadh Prince Mohammed - Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler - said it would reach the target without affecting the ""stability of global energy markets"".He said the country also would cut its emissions of methane by 30% by 2030.The plans would rely on ""the availability of the required technologies to manage and reduce emissions"" the prince said.Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman said the country would use carbon capture - technology that extracts CO2 from the air - to help it meet the goal.Earlier this year Saudi Arabia said it would reduce carbon emissions by shifting to renewable energy and planting billions of trees.Richard Black senior associate at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) a UK-based think tank described Saudi Arabia's net-zero target as ""very welcome"" but said the kingdom needed to publish a plan of how it would be achieved.""There's a lack of clarity... it would be really good to see that stuff made clear"" he said adding that the carbon-capture commitments were ""really speculative"".Since the net-zero target only applies to domestic emissions it may mean Saudi Arabia will not need to reduce its oil and gas production. Carbon emissions from fossil fuels burned by other nations once the kingdom ships them abroad will not be counted.""There's a lot of people who will be cynical about this unless Saudi Arabia plans to ramp down its production of oil and gas which it has no plans on doing"" Mr Black said.You may be interested in watching:This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media captionWATCH: The BBC's Nick Beake meets young climate activists trying to stop Norway drilling for oil and gas";Saudi Arabia commits to net zero emissions by 2060;https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-58955584;mindset;0.930000
"Former refugees in US to Afghans: 'You are not alone'â¯By Bernd Debusmann JrBBC NewsPublished4 days agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage sourceGetty ImagesImage captionAfghan refugees arriving in the US in AugustWARNING: This story contains graphic descriptions of violence.Hundreds of Afghans are starting new lives in the US after escaping the Taliban. What advice do other former refugees living in the US have for them about what's ahead?When Louisiana resident Dauda Sesay was 16 years old he watched as his father was executed before his eyes.He was outside playing with friends when rebels attacked and lined the children up to chop off their hands. His father quickly rushed to the scene to save them.""He knelt down and pleaded on our behalf to leave the children alone"" he told the BBC. ""Those were my dad's last words... unfortunately he was shot while making his case.""Mr Sesay survived. After being shot in the leg and losing consciousness international forces rescued him and transported him to Gambia leaving behind a brutal civil war in Sierra Leone that also claimed the life of his younger sister.Now in his late 30s Mr Sesay is one of the more than three million refugees and asylum seekers that have found a new home in the US since 1975.Image sourceCourtesy Dauda SesayImage captionDauda SesayMany - like Mr Sesay - have come to the US after leaving homelands ravaged by war and civil strife such as Bosnia the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Iraq. Still others are fleeing repressive governments instability or simply abject poverty. In many cases it's a combination of these factors.The number of new refugees in the US is expected to double following the Biden administration's decision toraise the refugee admissions capto 125000 for the 2022 fiscal year which began on 1 October. It had already been raised from 15000 to 62500 earlier in May.The newcomers are likely to include thousands of Afghans who didn't meet the minimum requirements of the US Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) programme available for those who helped the US military. The State Department has said that other at-risk Afghans will have ""enhanced access"" to the US refugee admissions programme.As these newcomers begin to navigate life in America refugees already in the US say they can't help but think of their own experiences arriving in the country - the good the bad and the ugly.""We look at each other and have one thing in common"" said Mr Sesay who now serves on the board of the advocacy organisation Refugee Congress and is president of the Louisiana Organization for Refugees and Immigrants.""In one way or another each of us was forced to flee and look for safety.""A shock to the systemAfter nine years in a refugee camp in Gambia Mr Sesay and his wife - a fellow refugee - were resettled in the US by the UN. When they arrived in Louisiana in 2009 Mr Sesay remembers fewer than 10 Sierra Leonean families living there.""There's that excitement of coming that you're leaving a refugee camp and travelling to the US"" he recalled. ""But after a while you start getting to the reality of the land.""Mr Sesay said that he quickly realised that the US is extremely different culturally from his homeland - a problem that plagues refugees from many parts of the globe.For example in Sierra Leone making eye contact with elders when they are talking is a sign of disrespect ""but here if you don't do that it looks like you're not honest"" he pointed out.His initial feelings of isolation were made worse when he began university where he was bullied by a professor who refused to call him by his name. ""I was fulfilling the dream of my late father"" he said. ""Instead I had this obstacle this professor calling me names. It almost made me drop out of school.""His fellow students eventually intervened.Image sourceCourtesy Lubab Al-QuraishiImage captionLubab Al-QuraishiLubab Al-Quraishi an Iraqi refugee in New Jersey recalled a moment of shock when a woman in a Walmart began verbally abusing her for wearing a traditional hijab.""She was criticising me and shouting. I was so afraid. She told me to go back to my country"" said Ms Al Quraish.She had mixed feelings about America.On one hand she was relieved that her family had managed to leave Iraq where in 2009 she had narrowly escaped an attempt on her life as she drove to work at Baghdad Medical College.Image sourceGetty ImagesImage captionA US troop greets an Afghan child who arrived in the US in August""I don't know why they wanted to kill me. Nobody was immune"" she said. ""When it became a matter of life or death it was time to leave. I had kids and a family.""â¯Her newfound safety came at a cost.How many Afghan refugees are fleeing?What now for Afghans arriving in America?In Iraq she lived the life of a professional as a doctor and assistant professor of medicine - complete with a large house and two cars - in the US she was resettled in a blighted section of Houston.Her education and medical experience meant nothing in her new home. To support herself she began working a drive-thru counter at a fast-food chicken restaurant followed by stints at a bakery and as a pharmacy cashier.""I felt as if I'd been insulted for years"" she said. ""Nobody would look at me as a physician. Nobody gave me an opportunity.""â¯Over time Ms Al Quraishi worked her way back into medicine from an entry-level position first as a pharmacy tech and now as a licensed pathologist assistant.â¯Even 10 years after arriving and becoming a US citizen Ms Al Quraishi said she still does not feel at home.""I don't feel as if I belong. I'm a citizen but I still feel I'm not welcome"" she said. ""There are certain places I cannot go because of my hijab. People will give me looks.""'Parents have to understand'Washington DC-based Jessi Calzado-Esponda recalled more than anything a feeling of confusion.In 1995 - at the age of seven - Ms Calzado-Esponda was rescued at sea in a raft alongside 16 other people who fled Cuba. After seven months at a refugee camp in Guantanamo Bay she and her grandmother moved to Florida.""It happens in the blink of an eye"" she said of the change from a life surrounded by extended family to a new unfamiliar one suddenly thrust upon her. ""It was a very traumatising experience.""""Nobody ever explained to me why I just spent six days in a raft then in a refugee camp and a different country"" she said.What is my sin? Afghan interpreters blocked by UK'My Mam fled a country in civil war as a child'Data from the UN suggests that as many as a quarter of all refugee children around the world suffer from loneliness and depression as well as high rates of anxiety and post-traumatic stress. Often the problems are compounded by bullying and other forms of social exclusion.George Tarr who came to the US as a refugee from Liberia at the age of seven said that he experienced that first-hand when he began school in New York City.""We faced a lot of discrimination. It was shocking to me because it came from people the same skin colour as us"" he said. ""There was a lot of bullyingâ¦ I fought with other kids a lot.""Image sourceCourtesy Jessi Calzado-EspondaImage captionJessi Calzado-EspondaYoung refugees face unique challenges and new Afghan arrivals should as much as possible help their children by taking advantage of any resources that can be available for youths said Ms Calzado-Esponda.""They can get the mental health help their families need"" she said. ""Those conversations need to happen so that children understand they're in a safer environment.""Making a homeLooking ahead to the expected influx of Afghan and other refugees into American communities following Mr Biden's decision to raise the refugee cap many past refugees believe their own experiences can serve as lessons for the newcomers.Ms Al Quraishi for example said she would advise incoming refugees - many of whom will be leaving respected professions in Afghanistan - to ""work with dignity"" no matter what they find themselves doing.â¯""I'd tell them: work on yourself. Invest any penny that you can bring from your country of origin"" she said. ""Nobody's going to help you in the US to build your new life.""Others such as Mr Tarr say they believe that new refugees should be willing to ask for help even if that means overcoming cultural differences or a fear of the unknown.""Try to learn as much as possible. Don't be afraid to ask questions. When we first came here a lot of strangers helped us"" he said. ""People here are actually very friendly and very welcoming. Don't be afraid. People are actually more willing to help than you can ever know.""Image sourceCourtesy George TarrImage captionGeorge TarrMr Sesay said that he finally felt at home when he began celebrating festive occasions - such as Thanksgiving or Ramadan - with people in his new home.""All those things bring memories back"" he said. ""It's just in a different way.""There is little advice that anyone can give to refugees working to overcome lingering trauma in a starkly different country than their own he said but strength of will ""will go a long way.""But new refugees are not alone. ""Others have been in these situations and were able to survive"" he said.

"Brazil senators back criminal charges against Bolsonaro over Covid handlingPublished6 hours agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsCoronavirus pandemicImage sourceEPAImage captionJair Bolsonaro was visiting the border with Venezuela on Tuesday to look at the migrant crisis thereBrazilian senators have voted to recommend charging President Jair Bolsonaro over his handling of the devastating Covid pandemic.A Senate panel backed a report calling for charges against Mr Bolsonaro including crimes against humanity after 600000 deaths from coronavirus.The findings will be sent to the chief prosecutor a Bolsonaro appointee.The president has maintained he is ""guilty of absolutely nothing"" but the crisis has dented his popularity.Brazil's death toll is second only to that of the United States.There is no guarantee this vote will lead to actual criminal charges as the report's recommendations must now be assessed by Prosecutor-General Augusto Aras who is expected to protect the president.The report alleges that Mr Bolsonaro's government pursued a policy of allowing coronavirus to rip through the country in the hope of achieving herd immunity.It describes the president as ""the main person responsible for the errors committed by the federal government during the pandemic"".The report's lead author centrist Senator Renan Calheiros called for the panel's recommendation to charge President Bolsonaro with crimes against humanity to be submitted to the International Criminal Court (ICC).Brazil is a party to the Rome Statute which created the ICC so the international court could take up the case.But a referral would only be a first step in a lengthy process in which it would be up to the ICC to determine the merits of the case and whether to take it forward.In addition to crimes against humanity the Senate committee has recommended eight further charges be brought against Mr Bolsonaro in Brazilian courts including incitement to crime falsification of documents and the violation of social rights.Mr Bolsonaro is also accused of misusing public funds and spreading fake news about the pandemic.The 1300-page report also recommended bringing charges against two corporations and 77 other people including three of the president's adult sons.Following the announcement Senator Calheiros said that the ""chaos of Jair Bolsonaro's government will enter history as the lowest level of human destitution"".The vote concludes a six-month inquiry which has highlighted scandals and corruption inside the government.The Senate's recommendation is expected to be delivered to the prosecutor-general on Wednesday morning.His office said it would be carefully reviewed as soon as it was received the Associated Press reports.YouTube removes Bolsonaro videos for Covid misinfoThroughout the process Mr Bolsonaro has insisted that his government ""did the right thing from the first moment"" of the pandemic and his allies have been quick to dismiss Tuesday's recommendations as being driven entirely by ""political and electoral"" motivations.""It is a totally political report without any legal basis"" said Flavio Bolsonaro one of the president's sons accused in the report.""The intent of some senators on the investigative committee is to cause the maximum amount of wear and tear on the president.""Former US President Donald Trump a Bolsonaro ally said in a statement he endorsed the Brazilian president because ""he fights hard for and loves the people of Brazil"".Today marked the end of a long process. Six months of hearings scandals uncovered a light shone on a government accused of recklessness.Just before the vote leading senators delivered impassioned speeches.

"Colombian drug lord Otoniel to be extradited to USPublished2 days agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage sourceColombian Police/Handout via REUTERSImage captionDairo Antonio Ãsuga better known as Otoniel led Colombia's largest criminal gangColombia has announced that the country's most wanted drug trafficker will be extradited to the US after he was captured in a raid.Dairo Antonio Ãsuga known as Otoniel was seized after a joint army air force and police operation on Saturday.He led the country's largest criminal gang and has been on the US Drug Enforcement Agency's most wanted list for years.US officials had placed a $5m (Â£3.6m) bounty on his head.They accused him of importing at least 73 metric tonnes of cocaine into the country between 2003 and 2014.What will happen to him?Colombia's Defence Minister Diego Molano told El Tiempo newspaper that the next step for officials was to comply with the US extradition order.Authorities have now taken Otoniel to a military base in the capital BogotÃ¡ ahead of his extradition according to newspaper El Nuevo Siglo.Being locked up in a jail thousands of miles from their home country in a place where they have few connections and no means to intimidate guards or prison directors is a fate many Colombian drug traffickers fear.The late drug lord Pablo Escobar said that he would prefer ""lying in a grave in Colombia than being locked up in a cell in the US"".Except for a six-year period between 1991 and 1997 when Colombia's constitution banned extraditions of Colombian citizens a number of top level traffickers facing indictments in the US have been sent to stand trial there.Among them are the co-founder of the MedellÃ­n cartelCarlos Lehder drug lordDaniel ""The Madman"" Barreraand paramilitary leaderSalvatore Mancuso.Otoniel who was indicted in the the US in 2009 will faces a number of charges including sending shipments of cocaine to the US killing police officers and recruiting children.How was he caught?Otoniel was captured in his rural hideout in Antioquia province in north-western Colombia close to the border with Panama.The operation involved 500 soldiers supported by 22 helicopters. One police officer was killed.Otoniel had used a network of rural safe houses to move around and evade the authorities and did not use a phone instead relying on couriers for communication.In the past police have found special orthopaedic mattresses for Otoniel in these sparse homes as he suffered back pain from a herniated disc.Police chief Jorge Vargas has said the drug lord was fearful of capture ""never approaching inhabited areas"".BACKGROUND: Colombia's hunt for an elusive drug lordBut El Tiempo reported that authorities managed to pinpoint the location where he was eventually captured two weeks ago.Chief Vargas said his movements were traced by more than 50 signal intelligence experts using satellite imagery. US and UK agencies were involved in the search.Mr Duque described the operation as ""the biggest penetration of the jungle ever seen in the military history of our country"".This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media captionDairo Antonio Ãsuga was led away in handcuffs following the raidColombia's armed forces later released a photo showing its soldiers guarding Otoniel who was in handcuffs and wearing rubber boots.There have been several huge operations involving thousands of officers to capture the 50-year-old in recent years.There's no doubt this is seen as a coup by Colombian authorities - they've been trying to capture Otoniel for several years now. The Gulf Cartel is a formidable and violent organisation with a great deal of power.And the comparisons with Pablo Escobar are understandable. Otoniel is a household name and has been hugely powerful especially in the north west of the country.""In South America there is no larger cocaine trafficker"" says Toby Muse author of Kilo: Inside the Cocaine Cartels. ""We are living in the golden age of cocaine we are producing more cocaine than ever - that's a fact.""But the parallels perhaps stop there - Otoniel is not as well-known outside of Colombia. And speak to people who lived in the country at the peak of Pablo Escobar's power many feel they were more frightening times.The question is will Otoniel's capture impact the trade of the illicit drug? It's hard to know now. We'll have to see what happens in the coming months but most experts seem to think that while demand for cocaine remains strong it's likely there will be new ""capos"" rising to the top to replace him.Who is Otoniel?Born in Antioquia in the early 1970s Otoniel jumped between several guerrilla and paramilitary groups - including the Farc (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) the major Marxist-Leninist rebel group and the United Self-Defence Forces of Colombia (AUC) a far-right paramilitary and drug trafficking gang.When the AUC dissolved in 2005 he began working for the drug lord Daniel RendÃ³n Herrera known as Don Mario - head of the UrabeÃ±os which later became known as the Gulf Clan.Otoniel then took charge of the group after its previous leader - his brother - was killed by police in a raid on a New Year's Eve party almost 10 years ago.Colombia's security forces labelled the gang as the country's most powerful criminal organisation while authorities in the US describe it as ""heavily armed [and] extremely violent"".The gang which operates in many provinces and has extensive international connections is engaged in drug and people smuggling illegal gold mining and extortion.It is believed to have about 1800 armed members who are mainly recruited from far-right paramilitary groups. Members have been arrested in Argentina Brazil Honduras Peru and Spain.The gang controls many of the routes used to smuggle drugs from Colombia to the US and as far away as Russia.The Colombian government however believes it has decimated its numbers in recent years forcing many leading members to hide in remote regions in the jungle.Related TopicsDrugs tradeUnited StatesColombiaMore on this storyUS indicts Colombia gang membersPublished24 June 2015Colombia targets gang after deadly blastPublished12 April 2018";Colombian drug lord to be sent to US after capture;https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-59032300;mindset;0.930000
"Living with the world's oldest mummiesBy Jane ChambersArica ChilePublished2 days agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage sourceCourtesy University of TarapacÃ¡Image captionThe Chinchorro mummified children - in this case a boy estimated to be six or seven - as well as adults""It may seem strange for some people to live on top of a graveyard but we're used to it"" says Ana MarÃ­a Nieto who lives in the Chilean port city of Arica.Arica on the border with Peru is built on the sandy dunes of the Atacama desert the driest desert in the world.But long before the coastal town was founded in the 16th Century this area was home to the Chinchorro people.Their culture hit the news in July when the United Nations' cultural organisation Unesco added hundreds of mummies preserved by them to its World Heritage List.The Chinchorro mummies were first documented in 1917 by German Archaeologist Max Uhle who had found some of the preserved bodies on a beach. But it took decades of research to determine their age.Radiocarbon dating eventually showed that the mummies were more than 7000 years old - more than two millennia older than the more widely known Egyptian mummies.Chinchorro cultureImage sourceCourtesy University of TarapacÃ¡Pre-ceramic culture that lasted from 7000 to 1500 BCSedentary fishers and hunter-gatherersLived in what is now northernmost Chile and southern PeruMummified their dead in a sophisticated and evocative mannerMummification is believed to have started as a way to keep the memories of the dead aliveThat makes the Chinchorro mummies the oldest known archaeological evidence of artificially mummified bodies.Anthropologist Bernardo Arriaza an expert on the Chinchorro says they practiced intentional mummification. That means they used mortuary practices to conserve the bodies rather than leave them to naturally mummify in the dry climate - although some naturally mummified bodies have also been found at the sites.Small incisions would be made to a body the organs taken out and the cavities dried while the skin was ripped off Mr Arriaza explains.The Chinchorro people would then stuff the body with natural fibres and sticks to keep it straight before using reeds to sew the skin back on.They would also attach thick black hair onto the mummy's head and cover its face with clay and a mask with openings for the eyes and mouth.Image sourceGetty ImagesImage captionThe Chinchorro mummified children and babies as well as adultsImage sourceGetty ImagesImage captionThey covered the mummies' faces with clay masksImage sourceEye UbiquitousImage captionThick black hair was attached onto the mummies' headsFinally the body was painted in a distinctive red or black colour using pigments from minerals ochre manganese and iron oxide.The Chinchorro's methods and approach to mummification differed markedly from that of the Egyptians Mr Arriaza says.Not only did the Egyptians use oil and bandages mummification was also reserved for deceased members of the elite whereas the Chinchorro mummified men women children babies and even foetuses regardless of their status.Living with the deadWith hundreds of mummies found in Arica and other sites over the past century locals learned to live alongside - and often on top of - the remains.Discovering human remains during building works or having your dog sniff out and dig up parts of a mummy is something generations of locals have experienced. But for a long time they did not realise just how significant these remains were.""Sometimes the residents tell us stories about how the children used the skulls for footballs and took the clothing off the mummies but now they know to report back to us when they find something and to leave it alone"" archaeologist Janinna Campos Fuentes says.Locals Ana MarÃ­a Nieto and Paola Pimentel are thrilled that Unesco has recognised the significance of the Chinchorro culture.Image sourceIvan AstudilloImage captionAna MarÃ­a Nieto (left) and Paola Pimentel are excited about more people learning about the mummiesThe women lead neighbour associations near two of the excavation sites and have been working closely with a group of scientists from the local TarapacÃ¡ University to help the community understand the importance of the Chinchorro Culture and to make sure the precious sites are looked after.There are plans for a neighbourhood museum - where rows of Chinchorro remains lie under reinforced glass for visitors to peer at - to get a new interactive extension. The idea is to train locals as guides so they can show off their heritage to others.Currently only a tiny part of the more than 300 or so Chinchorro mummies are on display. Most of them are housed at the San Miguel de Azapa Archaeological Museum.The museum which is owned and run by TarapacÃ¡ University is a 30-minute drive from Arica and has impressive displays showing the mummification process.A larger museum is being planned on the site to house more of the mummies but funds are also needed to ensure they are correctly preserved so they do not deteriorate.Mr Arriaza and archaeologist Jannina Campos are also convinced that Arica and the surrounding hills still hold many treasures that have yet to be discovered. But more resources are needed to find them.The mayor Gerardo Espindola Rojas hopes the addition of the mummies to the World Heritage List will boost tourism and attract additional funds.Image sourceFelipe Tobar AlduanteImage captionGerardo Espindola Rojas wants the community to reap the benefits of increased tourismBut he is mindful that any development should be done in the right way working with the community and safeguarding the sites.""Unlike Rome that sits on monuments the people of Arica are living on top of human remains and we need to protect the mummies.""Urban planning laws are in place and archaeologists are present whenever building works are carried out he says to make sure the precious remains are not disturbed.Mayor Espindola is also adamant that unlike in some other parts of Chile where tour operators and multinational companies have bought up land to reap profit from tourist sites Arica's heritage should remain in the hands of its people and benefit the local community.Neighbourhood association president Ana Maria Prieto is positive the newfound fame of the mummies will work in everyone's favour.""This is a small town but a friendly one. We want tourists and scientists from all over the world to come and learn about the incredible Chinchorro Culture that we've been living with all our life.""If you want to know more about the Chinchorro mummies listen to Jane Chamber's report on Discovery on the BBC World Service.Related TopicsArchaeologyChileMore on this storyEgypt's ancient rulers return in mummies' paradePublished3 AprilMummies with golden tongues unearthed in EgyptPublished2 FebruaryEgyptian mummified animals 'digitally unwrapped'Published20 August 2020";Living with the world's oldest mummies;https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-58639748;mindset;0.930000

Eventually the 12-week deadline for an abortion passed and Paulina still only a child herself had to carry the baby to full term.The suffering of that time has never fully left her but she is greatly encouraged by a unanimous ruling from Mexico's Supreme Court last month to decriminalise abortion. Specifically the decision referred to the law in the northern state of Coahuila but it set a precedent for the entire country.Image caption""There's still mountains to overcome"" Teresa Mesa says""I cried!

At that time there was no legal protection for women no places of an adequate health standard to carry them out and really a lot of social stigma.""Teresa hopes the measure will make it easier for other girls to have an abortion than it was for her particularly as neighbouring Texas in the US moves in the opposite direction towards much stricter control.""This is just the start. There's still mountains to overcome before this is fully legal. We need proper health clinics which carry out abortions and doctors that are prepared to do them.""""And it's not just about normalising abortion"" she continues ""but also making visible the domestic violence under which so many women live in Coahuila.

I met members of the Coahuila branch as they plastered posters with their contact details on them at bus stops around the state capital Saltillo.""We helped nearly 300 women last year to obtain abortion pills or travel to Mexico City"" where abortion is legal the group's founder Malu Reina told me.Although their opponents paint them as somehow ""promoting abortion"" Ms Reina says that is a deliberate mischaracterisation and that the co-operative provides sexual health education and support to vulnerable mothers in Coahuila's marginalised communities.ANALYSIS:Can one country's abortion law change a continent?ON THE GROUND:The rape survivors facing an âimpossible choiceâ in BrazilNevertheless there are some powerful forces in Mexico lined up against the new law.

They say they are determined to block the court's decision.""The Supreme Court has failed against the fundamental freedom of life"" argues Rodrigo Ivan Cortes president of the National Front for the Family.""Now they also want to proceed against the fundamental freedom of the health sector and take out the freedom of conscious objection for doctors and nurses.

"Haiti sees nearly 800 kidnappings so far this year NGO saysPublished6 days agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage sourceGetty ImagesImage captionThe security situation has deteriorated amid the country's political instabilityNearly 800 kidnappings have been reported in Haiti so far this year a local group says as gangs expand their control amid political instability.The Center for Analysis and Research in Human Rights (CARDH) said 119 people were abducted in the first half of this month alone.People from all walks of life both local and foreign have been targeted.The most recent high-profile case involves 17 missionaries from the US and Canada kidnapped last weekend.The security situation in Haiti which was already precarious has deteriorated significantly since the assassination of President Jovenel MoÃ¯se in July. Rival factions are fighting to gain control of the country in the face of a struggling police force.""Citizens do not trust the Haitian national police and this poses a problem because we cannot have an efficient police force if the population does not collaborate"" Gedeon Jean the CARDH director told AFP news agency.""According to our statistics there are at least two policemen in every large armed group: some policemen are active in gangs and others provide cover allowing gangs to operate or they share information with them.""CARDH said at least 782 kidnappings were reported this year to 16 October compared with 796 cases in the whole of 2020. The actual numbers were likely to be much higher it said as many people do not report abductions fearing retaliation from the gangs.The rise in violence and a dire economic situation made worse by several natural disasters in recent years have led to a growing number of Haitians seek opportunities in other countries.FEATURE:'I'd rather risk death than be deported to Haiti'On Saturday the missionaries from the Ohio-based Christian Aid Ministries were returning from a visit to an orphanage when their bus was seized by members of the 400 Mazowo gang in Ganthier a town east of the capital Port-au-Prince.Ganthier is located in the Croix-des-Bouquets area which is controlled by the gang. The kidnappers are demanding $1m (Â£725000) in ransom for each hostage.All of those kidnapped are US citizens except one who is a Canadian national. Among those seized are five men seven women and five children the youngest reported to be two years old.Seizing vehicles and all of their occupants for ransom is one of the main activities the 400 Mazowo uses to finance itself. In April the gang abducted a group of Catholic clergy who were later released. It is not clear if a ransom was paid.Related TopicsHaitiPort-au-PrinceMore on this storyHaiti kidnappers 'demand $17m' for missionariesPublished19 October";Nearly 800 kidnappings in Haiti this year - NGO;https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-58993730;mindset;0.930000

The change had already been recommended by a constitutional review in 1998.The historic election came after a joint session of the House of Assembly and the Senate on Wednesday. Prime Minister Mia Mottley described the vote as a ""seminal moment"" for the nation.With a population of about 285000 Barbados is one of the more populous and prosperous Caribbean islands. Once heavily dependent on sugar exports its economy has diversified into tourism and finance.Barbados will not be the first former British colony in the Caribbean to become a republic.

But for those angry over how he handled the pandemic the allegations are serious and they want to see justice done.And that's where the sticking point seems to have been - original accusations of mass homicide and indigenous genocide have been removed from the report because there was no consensus. Instead they've been replaced by the crime of ""epidemic resulting in death"" - as well as other charges including crimes against humanity and misuse of public funds.There are 11 senators that make up the inquiry - seven of which are critics of President Bolsonaro. But the critics all need to agree on the charges in order for them to get a majority and ensure the recommendations can be voted on and taken to federal prosecutors who can decide the next step.Despite the serious allegations it is not clear what this means for Mr Bolsonaro according to our correspondent.The draft report still needs to be voted on by the Senate commission where it could be vetoed and altered and there is no guarantee it will lead to criminal charges.Image sourceReutersImage captionPresident Bolsonaro continues to oppose any lockdown measures to curb the outbreakPresident Bolsonaro has dismissed the Congressional inquiry as politically motivated. He has frequently spoken out against lockdowns masks and vaccinations.In Marchhe told Brazilians to ""stop whining"" about Covid a day after the country saw a record rise in deaths over a 24-hour period.However Mr Bolsonaro's popularity has already been dented by the pandemic and this report could make life much harder for him if he wants to run for a second term in Brazil's 2022 elections.Brazil's confirmed Covid-related death toll is the second-highest in the world - behind only the US.Covid - what's gone wrong in Brazil?Brazil variant drives South America Covid surgeSpeaking to the BBC ahead of the report's publication the inquiry rapporteur Senator Renan Calheiros said the panel wanted to punish those who contributed to ""this massacre of Brazilians"".This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media captionLooking after the babies and children in Brazil's Covid ICURelated TopicsJair BolsonaroBrazilCoronavirus pandemicMore on this storyBolsonaro calls governors 'tyrants' over lockdownsPublished22 MarchCovid - what's gone wrong in Brazil?Published9 AprilâStop whiningâ over Covid Brazilâs president saysPublished5 March";Bolsonaro should face charges over pandemic - report;https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-58976197;mindset;0.930000

"Blinken seeks to shore up democracy on South America tripAnthony ZurcherNorth America reporter@awzurcheron TwitterPublished7 days agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage sourceGetty ImagesImage captionUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Ecuador's President Guillermo LassoAntony Blinken's maiden trip to South America as secretary of state is to two of the continent's strongest democracies Ecuador and Colombia. Both at home and abroad the high-level visit is being regarded as a show of support for allies in a turbulent region increasingly rent by ideological splits and facing challenges from organised crime and drug-trafficking.On Tuesday he met recently elected Ecuador President Guillermo Lasso and Foreign Minister Mauricio Montalvo. He has a sit-down scheduled on Wednesday with Colombian President IvÃ¡n Duque and Vice-President and Foreign Minister Marta LucÃ­a RamÃ­rez.The US agendaThe meetings in Ecuador and Colombia will give the American secretary of state a chance to address a number of pressing concerns in a region that is geographically close to the US but not always at the top of its diplomatic agenda.Venezuela:The Nicolas Maduro regime has been a thorn in the US side through three presidential administrations. Now President Joe Biden's team will take its turn trying to rally regional support for democratic reforms in the socialist-run nation. The effort is off to a rocky start however with Maduro cancelling talks last weekend with the Venezuelan opposition coalition led by Juan Guaido following the extradition to the US of a Colombian businessman accused of money laundering for the Maduro regime.During a press conference in Quito on Tuesday Blinken said Maduro's action was ""deeply unfortunate"" and was indicative of a leader putting his personal interests over those of the people he should serve.The standoff is casting a shadow over next month's regional elections which the US has warned already appeared unlikely to produce a free and fair result.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media captionVenezuela's ongoing economic and political turmoil has created a major migrant crisis""Irregular"" Migration: Venezuela's political and economic crises have created an outflow of millions of refugees into Colombia Ecuador and other nearby nations threatening to destabilise the region. Of similar concern to the US however is the role South American countries have served as ""transit nations"" for migrants from elsewhere. The recent unprecedented surge of Haitian migrants arriving at the US-Mexico border had its origin in countries like Chile and Brazil where dwindling job opportunities and new immigration restrictions prompted recent arrivals and long-term residents alike to consider the arduous journey north in the hope that the US would be more welcoming.Brian Nichols assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs said in a pre-trip briefing that the Haitian situation will be a ""substantial focus"" of a regional ministerial meeting in Bogota on Thursday - and that every country in South America has a shared responsibility in stemming the migrant flow.Image sourceGetty ImagesImage captionA Venezuelan migrant sells handbags in a Colombian refugee campChina:In Quito on Wednesday morning Blinken is scheduled to give an address on ""democracy and good governance"". Part of the purpose of this trip according to Nichols is to underline what the US sees as the ""vibrant and inclusive"" democracies of Colombia and Ecuador. Unstated is the contrast the US wants to draw with decidedly undemocratic China - as the strategic and economic rivalry between the two global powers plays out across South America.On Tuesday Blinken said that the US partnership with Ecuador was not defined by any third country and that no nation should have to choose between the US and China.But he followed that with a warning - that in certain ""narrowly defined areas"" working with China comes with risks; that Chinese companies when push comes to shove will do the bidding of the Chinese government.Free and open democracies the American thinking goes will be more inclined to become ""partners of choice"" with the US than with authoritarian China. That marks a distinct contrast with the Trump administration whose ""America first"" foreign policy was more transactional and less focused on a partner nation's governance.This change in US outlook fits neatly with Biden's rhetorical emphasis on what he sees as an era-defining struggle between the world's democracies and authoritarian governments.""Ultimately we're focused together on demonstrating that democracies can achieve tangible results for our people"" Blinken said. ""That's the test.""But if South American nations do have to pick a side the American hope is that they look north not across the Pacific.The view from South AmericaReports in Colombian and Ecuador's media highlighted US officials saying that Blinken's presence in these countries was intended as a ""clear sign"" of support for ""vibrant and inclusive democracies that respect the rights of their citizens"".These reports also noted that Ecuador and Colombia and Latin America as a whole as well as the United States were grappling with the phenomenon of big surges of migrants on the move. The installation over the last year of left-wing governments in Bolivia and Peru had also reduced the numbers of Washington's friends in the Andean region.Image sourceGetty ImagesImage captionHaitian migrants crossing the Panama-Colombia borderA 19 October editorial in leading Ecuadorean daily El Comercio noted that after a decade in which bilateral ties were distant during the 2007-17 rule of the country's left-wing President Rafael Correa Ecuador and the US had resumed a closer relationship after 2017 and Blinken's visit would strengthen relations with the current government of President Guillermo Lasso.El Comercio predicted that Lasso's government would be looking for more generous US co-operation to help it fight corruption and confront threats from transnational drug cartels.In a move that appeared to reflect these growing problems President Lasso late on 18 October declared a 60-day state of emergency that mobilised the army and police to fight ""insecurity"".In Colombia leading daily El Espectador published an opinion column on 19 October that said Blinken's visit would seek to bolster the Colombian-US ""special relationship"" in the midst of a ""difficult panorama"". The column was written by former foreign minister Rodrigo Pardo.Pardo commented: ""The most pessimistic analysts consider that democracy itself is in danger in the region"".

"Poland told to pay â¬1m a day in legal row with EUPublished1 hour agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage sourceEPAImage captionOne opinion poll suggests most Poles think the government should either concede or compromiseThe EU's top court has told Poland to pay a daily fine of â¬1m (Â£850000) in an row over judicial reforms.Earlier this year Poland was ordered to suspend a controversial disciplinary chamber but has not yet done so.Poland has repeatedly been at loggerheads with the EU over changes that are seen as weakening the independence of Polish courts.This month Poland's Constitutional Tribunal angered European leaders by in effect rejecting the primacy of EU law.The ruling said parts of EU law were incompatible with the Polish constitution prompting European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to speak of a ""direct challenge to the unity of the European legal order"".The original case was taken to the tribunal by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki in a bid to prevent Polish judges using EU law to challenge his government's judicial changes.One significant factor in the EU-Poland row is that the European Commission is yet to approve â¬57bn (Â£48bn; $66bn) of Covid-19 recovery funds earmarked for Poland and may not do so until its judiciary dispute is settled.An opinion poll on Tuesday suggested that 40.8% of Poles believed their government should concede defeat and end the row while another 32.5% said it should compromise.A central plank of Poland's controversial reforms is a disciplinary chamber of the Supreme Court that critics argue is being used to punish independent judges because it has the power to sanction the content of their rulings.Back in July the European Court of Justice (ECJ) delivered an interim ruling that Poland should suspend the chamber as it was neither sufficiently independent nor impartial. The Polish prime minister has said the chamber will be shut down in its current form but he has insisted that EU institutions have no right to tell Warsaw how to organise its judiciary.BBC Warsaw correspondent Adam Easton says the Supreme Court has stopped scheduling new cases for the chamber but it has continued hearing cases that are already scheduled.Poland stokes fears of leaving EU in 'Polexit'Last month the EU asked the Luxembourg-based court to impose a daily fine until Poland responded.

"Spain grants joint custody of dog in rare rulingPublished4 hours agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage sourceGetty ImagesImage captionSpain is drafting legislation so that animals are no longer considered objects (file photo)A judge in Spain has granted joint custody of a dog to a separated couple who went to court to determine who the pet should live with.The Madrid court considered that both parties were ""jointly responsible"" and ""co-caretakers"" of Panda the dog.A lawyer who brought the case to court said it was a ""pioneering"" ruling.Spain is currently drafting new legislation so that animals are no longer considered objects and are legally recognised as living beings.This status would make it easier for a partner to request joint custody of a pet following a breakup.But Lola GarcÃ­a from the Law & Animals law firm brought this case to court under the 1987 European Convention for the Protection of Pet Animals which Spain ratified in 2017.She said it was a ""pioneering ruling"" because her client was able to declare herself not as a ""co-owner"" of Panda but as ""co-responsible"" and as a ""co-carer"".Panda's adoption contract veterinary bills and photographs where ""the three are seen as a family exactly the same as if it were a family photo with children"" were submitted as evidence Ms GarcÃ­a said according to RTVE.The judge ruled that ""the evidence in the proceedings reveals an affective relationship between the plaintiff and the dog that is worthy of legal guardianship"".Panda will now alternate between the two partners for a month at a time.Dog custody laws around the worldIn theUK dogs are legally seen as inanimate objects akin to cars houses or other personal items. Custody cases come down to determining who the sole owner is.InAustralia there is no legislation as to how to courts should navigate living arrangements for pets after a breakup.Francechanged its law in 2014 so that pets were considered ""living and feeling beings"" rather than ""movable goods"". The new status meant that couples could fight for shared custody in divorce cases.Related TopicsSpainPetsDogsMore on this storyMore people trying to give up lockdown dogsPublished10 September";Spain grants joint custody of dog in rare ruling;https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59062132;mindset;0.930000
"Moldova: Russia threatens gas supply in Europe's poorest stateBy Steve RosenbergBBC News Chisinau MoldovaPublished12 hours agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage captionMoldova's Foreign Minister Nicu Popescu is trying to look on the bright sideHis country is immersed in a gas crisis. But Nicu Popescu is trying to remain positive.""On Monday our country made history"" Moldova's foreign minister tells me. ""For the first time Moldova bought gas from a source that was not Russia's Gazprom.""The gas shipment from Poland's PGNiG was one million cubic metres.Moldova will need much larger volumes if Gazprom does what it has threatened to do: turn off the gas taps.Up until now 100% of Moldova's gas has come from Russia. But the contract to supply it expired at the end of September. Gazprom raised the price and Moldova balked at paying it. In the absence of a new deal the Russian energy giant reduced supplies prompting Moldova to declare a 30-day state of emergency. Gazprom accused Moldova of ""provoking a crisis"" and demanded repayment of a $709m (Â£514m) debt which Moldova disputes.Negotiations continue. Moldovan officials say they would like to sign a new contract with Gazprom but only if the terms are favourable.If there is no deal with Russia could Moldova one of Europe's poorest countries buy enough gas elsewhere?Image captionMoldova's gas contract with Gazprom expired at the end of last month""It's the worst time to have a gas crisis at home"" Mr Popescu admits. ""The prices are higher than ever. We see this market crunch on a global scale. But we've had support. In recent years Romania built a new gas pipeline into Moldova which gives us a safety valve. We've also had some advice from the European Union on how to diversify a country's gas supply within a few days.""Like many enterprises in Moldova the sugar factory in Drochia has been affected by the gas shortage.""We're able to use just a quarter of the gas we need"" manager Rostislav Magdei explains. ""We're topping that up with alternative sources of energy. We hope our government will compensate any losses arising from the high price of fuel.""Image captionThis sugar factory is among many businesses hit by the gas shortageOnce in Moscow's orbit Moldova has been tilting from Russia towards the West more recently.The country's leadership is now pro-European and supports closer ties with the EU. Many here suspect that the gas crisis is the Kremlin's way of expressing its disapproval.""This year we had parliamentary elections and the pro-Russia party lost"" says Sergiu Tofilat former energy adviser to the president of Moldova. ""We have a pro-Western party in power here. So Russia changed its approach on the gas supply. The Kremlin wants to punish the Moldovan people for voting against a pro-Russia party. It's pure politics.""""Vladimir Putin is trying to keep former Soviet countries within the area of influence of the Kremlin. We do not want to stay on our knees in front of Moscow. We must say no to Russian blackmail and we have the opportunity now to get rid of Russian influence in Moldova.""Image captionSergiu Tofilat former presidential adviser says the Kremlin is trying to punish his countryThe Kremlin denies using energy as a weapon. President Putin recently dismissed the suggestion as ""utter nonsense drivel and politically-motivated tittle-tattle.""EUROPEAN CRISIS:Is Russia squeezing Europe's gas supply?WHAT NEXT?Gas crisis leaves Europe searching for solutionsFor Moldova though reducing Russia's influence won't be easy. In energy terms Moldova is closely tied to Moscow. Not only has the country been 100% dependent on Russian gas. But its own gas company Moldovagaz is majority-owned by Gazprom. And more than 80% of Moldova's electricity comes from a Russian-owned power plant in Trans-Dniester - a separatist region of Moldova backed economically politically and militarily by Moscow.If you think of gas negotiations as a game of poker then Russia has a very strong hand.But Trans-Dniester could prove to be a weak point for Moscow.""Gazprom needs a gas contract with Moldova so that it can supply the breakaway region too with gas"" says Sergiu Tofilat. ""Gazprom is a public company with shares listed on the stock exchange. It cannot allow itself to sign a contract with the Trans-Dniester supplier that is not officially recognised.""In the town of Balti Moldovan motorists are feeling the effects of less gas. I see long lines at the propane station.Queuing up here are dozens of cars and disgruntled drivers.Image captionDrivers in Balti are fed up with having to queue for fuel""We're in this situation because we're looking towards Europe"" a taxi driver called Valera tells me. ""If we were with Russia everything would be different.""""The problem is"" says another driver Yura ""that our leaders now want to be friends with Europe and America. For cheap gas they should go to Moscow get an agreement. We need to bow down to Russia"".For a government that has set a pro-European course there is a danger: that a prolonged gas shortage and higher energy bills could make Moldovans question the direction in which their country is moving.Related TopicsGazpromRussiaMoldovaNatural gasMore on this storyPutin denies weaponising energy amid Europe crisisPublished13 OctoberWhy are gas prices so high?Published12 October";Russia threatens gas supply in Europe's poorest state;https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59048894;mindset;0.930000

"Joshua Kimmich: German footballer's vaccine hesitancy dismays expertsBy Joshua NevettBBC NewsPublished1 day agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage sourceGetty ImagesImage captionJoshua Kimmich denied he was an ""anti-vaxxer"" after expressing unease about long-term side effectsHe's one of Germany's superstar football players a role model who's supported charities that help people struggling during the coronavirus pandemic.But in recent days Joshua Kimmich's comments about the safety of Covid-19 vaccinations have threatened to take the shine off his image.Over the weekend the Bayern Munich midfielder 26 confirmed reports he had not yet had a vaccine over concerns about long-term studies.""I am of course aware of my responsibility"" Kimmich told broadcaster Sky Sport after a match on Saturday.""I follow all hygiene measures and get tested every two to three days. Everyone should make the decision for themselves.""Still Kimmich insisted he was not a ""Covid denier or an anti-vaxxer"".""There is a very good chance that I will still get vaccinated"" he said. ""It's simply that I still have some concerns.""Those concerns have been addressed by prominent German health experts and scientists who have criticised Kimmich for not setting a good example and misunderstanding how vaccines work.They say decades of research shows that long-term health problems are highly unlikely after receiving a vaccination of any kind. Given this one leading medical ethicist suggested Kimmich had been the victim of Covid disinformation online.With coronavirus infections on the rise and jab uptake slowing down there are fears that Kimmich's comments could encourage vaccine hesitancy in Germany.'That's not how it works'Because Covid vaccines are relatively new scientists have not had time to study them over a long period - but that doesn't mean they're not safe.Covid jabs have been given to millions of people as well as being tested robustly in clinical trials.That's why experts stress the benefits of vaccination against Covid outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people.While Covid jabs will continue to be monitored for safety by regulators the chance of them causing serious side effects in the short or long term is considered low.Carsten Watzl a professor of immunology at Technical University Dortmund said the belief that vaccines could have long-term side effects was a common ""misunderstanding"".""Say: I let myself get vaccinated and perhaps next year I will have some grave side-effects. That's not how it works""Mr Watzl told the public broadcaster ARD. ""The side-effects of a vaccine always appear directly after the vaccination within a few weeks.""Health authorities worldwide have come to the same conclusion. For examplethe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says""serious side effects that could cause a long-term health problem are extremely unlikely following any vaccination"".""Millions of people have received Covid-19 vaccines and no long-term side effects have been detected"" the CDC says.More on Covid-19 vaccines:EXPLAINER:How do we know they are safe?STUDY:Vaccine complications dwarfed by virus risksWATCH:'We need to talk about misleading anti-vax claims'This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media captionBBC Reality Check debunks five false vaccine claimsThe head of Germany's expert panel on vaccine use Thomas Mertens said multiple studies have shown long-term side effects ""do not exist or are an extreme rarity"".""Joshua Kimmich is certainly a recognised expert on football issues but not an expert on vaccination"" Mr Mertens added.Dr Alena Buyx chairwoman of the German Ethics Council - a government advisory panel - suggested Kimmich had ""been given false information and been badly advised"".There are still many people ""who have questions or who have heard something wrong as was perhaps the case with Joshua Kimmich""Dr Alena Buyx told Sky Sport. ""You have to show these people sources they can trust.""Competing against vaccine hesitancyWhile Kimmich's comments have become a major talking point in Germany his vaccine reluctance is far from unique in the sporting world.World number one tennis player Novak Djokovic is a prominent case in point.Image sourceGetty ImagesImage captionNovak Djokovic has previously said he was opposed to mandatory vaccinations against Covid-19Last year Djokovic said he was ""opposed to vaccination"" before a controversial exhibition tour in Serbia and Croatia. The Serbian tennis star and three other players later tested positive for the virus.He insisted his comments about vaccinations had been taken out of context in the media. ""My issue here with vaccines is if someone is forcing me to put something in my body. That I don't want"" he said.Concerns have been raised about vaccine hesitancy and scepticism in other sports worldwide from athletics to basketball.In the English Premier League the unease has been particularly acute. As of last week only 68% of players were fully vaccinated against Covid the league said.That's way short of the figures in other countries such as Germany and Italy whose top football leagues say over 90% of their players are fully vaccinated.Why are some footballers vaccine hesitantVaccinations are not compulsory for Premier League players nor those of Germany's top flight the Bundesliga. But given the poster-boy status of Kimmich who recently captained the German national team his stance on vaccination has frustrated even his admirers.Last year Kimmich co-founded the We kick Corona initiative by donating money to support vaccination campaigns and charitable projects.Despite this Kimmich is one of five Bayern Munich players who are not vaccinatedthe Bild newspaper reported.'He will make the right decision'Kimmich's club has urged its players and staff to get jabbed while senior leaders have spoken out about the issue.Bayern CEO Oliver Kahn said the club could only recommend vaccinations to players and had done so through several campaigns. Even so he said the club respects players who have a ""different opinion"".The president of Bayern Herbert Hainen echoed those views.""FC Bayern supports the vaccination campaign"" he said. ""At the end of the day there is no compulsory vaccination with us. It is the decision of each individual and you have to accept that.""The club's former CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said he knew Kimmich to be an ""extremely responsible"" person who would probably ""make the right decision at some point"".Image sourceGetty ImagesImage captionKimmich donned the captain's armband for Germany in its 2-1 victory over Romania earlier this monthKimmich made his scepticism known at a time when rising coronavirus infections are raising the prospect of a return to tougher restrictions in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.On Monday Germany reported 6573 new infections and 17 deaths over the previous 24-hour period.Meanwhile the vaccination rate per 100 people continues to fall after peaking in June.

"Crimean gold must return to Ukraine - Dutch courtPublished1 day agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsUkraine conflictImage sourceAllard Pierson Museum AmsterdamImage captionIncluded in the collection was a gold Scythian ceremonial helmet (L) dating back to the 4th Century BCA Dutch appeals court has ruled in favour of Ukraine in a long-running wrangle over a historic collection of ancient treasures that was prompted by Russia's annexation of Crimea.The legal dispute began in 2014 when four Crimean museums tried to force the Allard Pierson museum in Amsterdam to send the gold back.Ukraine maintains the treasures now held in storage are state property.The appeal court in Amsterdam on Tuesday agreed.The museums backed by Russia could still take the case to the Supreme Court so there is little chance of the Scythian Gold collection being moved just yet.The Allard Pierson museum said in a statement it was ""pleased that a verdict has been reached and that another step has been taken towards the eventual completion of this case"" but stressed it had no opinion on the appeal court's ruling.The exhibition ""Crimea - Gold and secrets of the Black Sea"" went on display in Amsterdam in February 2014 the month that Ukraine's pro-Moscow president was ousted and Russian forces seized Crimea from Ukraine. A disputed referendum on annexation the following month was rejected by the EU and US as illegal.The treasures were loaned by five museums one in Ukraine's capital Kyiv and four in Crimea itself.

The Yazidi a Kurdish group from northern Iraq were a particular target of IS brutality.The court found Wenisch guilty of belonging to a foreign terrorist organisation and of assisting attempted murder an attempted war crime and a crime against humanity.As a member of IS it ruled she supported the ""destruction of the Yazidi religion"" and ""enslavement of the Yazidi people"".The judges said she had also threatened to shoot the Yazidi girl if she did not stop crying.Court spokesman Florian Gliwitzky said: ""The court handed down a sentence of nine years for the death of the child resulting from slavery which it viewed as a crime against humanity and two years and six months for membership of a terror group. This was made into a total sentence of 10 years.""Wenisch stood trial in Germany because of the legal principle of universal jurisdiction which allows prosecutions for alleged war crimes including genocide occurring overseas. She was arrested in Turkey in 2016 then extradited to Germany AFP news agency reports.Wenisch allegedly served in an IS ""anti-vice squad"" which enforced strict Islamic rules in Mosul and Fallujah.London-based human rights lawyer Amal Clooney was part of the legal team representing the girl's mother.In 2014 IS fighters stormed into the ancestral heartland of the Yazidi people in northern Iraq seizing thousands of women and children as slaves.You may also be interested in:From rape survivor in Iraq to Nobel Peace PrizeThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media captionNadia Murad: ""I wish the whole world would let women feel safe""Related TopicsGermanyYazidisIraqIslamic State groupMore on this storyIS suspect on trial in Germany for Yazidi genocidePublished24 April 2020The 'forgotten' people of an unforgettable storyPublished5 September 2018Who are the Yazidis?Published8 August 2014";German IS woman jailed for Yazidi girl's death;https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59036964;mindset;0.930000

"Climate change: Australia pledges net zero emissions by 2050Published1 day agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsCOP26This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media captionPM Scott Morrison sets out ""a uniquely Australian way"" of meeting climate commitmentsLeading global coal and gas supplier Australia has pledged to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.Prime Minister Scott Morrison however said the plan would not include ending Australia's fossil fuel sectors.The nation will also not set ambitious targets for 2030 - an objective of next month's COP26 global climate summit.His plan has drawn criticism with Murdoch University fire ecology expert Joe Fontaine saying it had ""all the strength of a wet paper bag"".Australia has long dragged its heels on climate action. It has some of the highest emissions per head of population and is a massive exporter of fossil fuels.Strategic allies the US and UK have both pledged to cut emissions faster. The UK has pledged thatall its electricity will come from renewable sources by 2035 while theUS has announced plans to halve its emissions by 2030compared to 2005 levels.""We won't be lectured by others who do not understand Australia. The Australian Way is all about how you do it and not if you do it. It's about getting it done"" Mr Morrison wrote in a newspaper column on Tuesday.To halt the worst effects of climate change nations have pledged to limit rising temperatures to 1.5C by 2050.This requires cutting emissions by 45% by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2050 scientists say. Over 100 nations have committed to carbon neutrality.Net zero means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It is achieved by a combination of cutting emissions as much as possible - mainly by reducing gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) which are released in the use of fossil fuels - and so-called offsetting measures such as planting trees and carbon-capture technology.What has Australia promised?Mr Morrison announced an investment of more than A$20bn (Â£11bn; $15bn) in ""low-emissions technologies"" over the next 20 years - such as efforts to capture carbon in soil lower solar energy costs and developing greener industries.But Australia will also use more gas at least in the short term. Most controversially there is no plan to limit fossil fuels.""We want our heavy industries like mining to stay open remain competitive and adapt so they remain viable for as long as global demand allows"" Mr Morrison wrote.Australia's 2030 commitment will remain a 26% cut on 2005 emissions. It is currently on track for a 30-35% reduction the government said.Why Australia refuses to give up coalClimate action is still hotly contested in AustraliaWhile the 2050 pledge has been widely welcomed the government has been ferociously criticised for not offering more details.Australia's Climate Council think tank said it was ""a joke without strong emissions cuts this decade"".Many said the government has been too slow on climate action despite seeing first-hand impacts such as bushfires floods and drought.""The word plan doesn't constitute a plan no matter how many times you say it"" said Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese.Scott Morrison's announcement is worth noting not because it offers anything different to other countries but because of how late to the party Australia is!This announcement took months of political wrangling and was left down to the wire with days before the COP26 summit in Glasgow.That the government had to make political concessions to its junior coalition partner - the National Party - shows you how complicated and politically divisive climate action is in Australia.The Nationals represent electorates in regional areas where most high-emission industries like coal mining are based. After days of toing and froing they backed the 'process'.The prime minister assured Australians the target will not mean paying more for their energy bills. ""Technology not taxes"" he said.He addressed regional Australians directly and said the plan won't involve shutting down coal and gas production or exports. He talked about billions of dollars invested in low-emission technologies. The government's plan would ""strike a balance"" Mr Morrison said.But he failed to explain how this balance will be struck. How the government will square keeping its coal industry for example and reaching net zero by 2050 - and what role technology will play in all of that. Especially when Canberra won't budge on its much-criticised 2030 targets.While this is a big moment for Australia the details are still murky and potentially problematic on how net zero will be achieved.";Australia's 2050 net zero pledge draws criticism;https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-59046032;mindset;0.930000

"Climate change: Why Australia refuses to give up coalBy Frances MaoBBC News SydneyPublished4 days agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage sourceABC NEWSImage captionScott Morrison famously praised coal's value to Australia in a parliamentary debate on renewable energy in 2017In a world racing to reduce pollution Australia is a stark outlier.It is one of the dirtiest countries per head of population and a massive global supplier of fossil fuels. Unusually for a rich nation it also still burns coal for most of its electricity.Australia's 2030 emissions target - a 26% cut on 2005 levels - is half the US and UK benchmarks.Canberra has also resisted joining the two-thirds of countries who have pledged net zero emissions by 2050.And instead of phasing out coal - the worst fossil fuel - it's committed to digging for more.So it's no surprise that Australia is being viewed as a ""bad guy"" going into the COP26 global climate talks in Glasgow analysts say.Prime Minister Scott Morrison's government is under huge pressure to do more.Loyalty to the industryMining has helped drive Australia's economy for decades and coal remains the country's second-biggest export.Only Indonesia sells more coal than Australia globally.The government often credits coal for much of the country's wealth but many analysts argue this is overblown.Coal exports totalled A$55bn (Â£29bn; $40bn) last year but most of this wealth was kept by mining companies. Less than a tenth went to Australia directly - that's about 1% of national revenue.The coal workforce of 40000 is about half the size of McDonald's in Australia. But coal jobs do sustain some rural communities.Image sourceGetty ImagesImage captionAustralia has 99 operating coal mines and ambitions to build moreThemining sector has always wielded influencein Canberra.Thoughmost voters want tougher climate action some coal towns lie in swing constituencies that are key to winning elections.The mining lobby has ""distorted"" much policy over the years says Prof Samantha Hepburn a climate law expert at Deakin University.The current government dismantled Australia's emissions trading scheme in 2014 shortly after winning power in a campaign heavily backed by mining interests.It's never again tried to put a price on carbon or to restrict emissions from fossil fuel producers.Instead it's provided extra support to coal.

Demand in Indonesia and Vietnam has also surged.But analysts say there's no long-term market as countries race to meet emissions goals.Australia's biggest coal buyers - Japan South Korea and China - have all pledged net zero targets by mid-century.Coal use has already plunged in North America and Europe. The G7 rich nations and China as well as many banks have committed to stop financing overseas coal projects.""Australia knows the party is over. But the police haven't been called yet. So they'll continue to party on until they're stopped"" says Richie Merzian a climate expert at the Australia Institute.Missing the green opportunity?Australia could end its literally toxic relationship with coal fairly quickly experts say.Its economy is stable and well-diversified to absorb the loss of coal exports.But Australia controversially sees liquefied natural gas - another dirty fuel - as its next big domestic energy source.The government has already pledged half a billion dollars to new gas basins and plants defying global calls for an end to new fossil fuel projects.This has frustrated those who say Australia should be investing to become a renewables superpower.As one of the sunniest and windiest continents on Earth Australia is ""uniquely placed to benefit economically"" from its abundant natural resources says the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) an intergovernmental organisation.Its industries are also well positioned to pivot to new export markets like green steel and aluminium.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media captionAustralia's lack of climate action is harming its own people activists argueAdvocates say coal workers could instead mine for the rare minerals needed for batteries and magnets that will power renewable energy grids.Canberra has put some money into renewables but the majority has come from state governments and businesses.Its allegiance to fossil fuels has scuppered progress critics say.The government has cut its renewables spending in recent years and there is no current national clean energy target.It has also withdrawn from the UN's Green Climate Fund and tried to change one local fund's mandate so taxpayer money could go to coal projects instead.""The rest of the world is accelerating past coal"" says the Climate Council a group of scientists.""Australia can either choose to reap the opportunities of this transition or be left poorer and less secure.""The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control.

He could face a sentence of up to life in prison.Testing of the substance in the packages showed it was heroin.The shipment originated in Malaysia and was bound for a business located in Melbourne. Several locations were later raided in the Victorian state capital.Speaking following the announcement Acting Assistant Commissioner Krissy Barrett of the Australian Federal Police said the discovery had been made thanks to close co-operation between international police forces.""We have a strong relationship with the Royal Malaysia Police (RMP) and in particular the RMP Narcotics Criminal Investigation Department"" she said.

"Hong Kong passes new film censorship lawPublished4 hours agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage sourceGetty ImagesImage captionCritics say the new law will affect Hong Kong's vibrant film industryHong Kong's legislature has passed a new law banning films deemed to violate China's national security interests the latest blow to freedom of expression in the territory.Punishment for violating the law includes up to three years imprisonment and $130000 (Â£95000) in fines.Critics say the legislation will stifle the vibrant local film industry.Last year China imposed a national security law on Hong Kong that effectively outlawed dissent.The legislation which came after huge pro-democracy protests in 2019 criminalises secession subversion terrorism and collusion with foreign forces. Critics say it is aimed at crushing dissent but China says it is meant to maintain stability.The film censorship law was approved in the opposition-free Legislative Council. It gives the chief secretary - the second-most powerful figure in the city's administration - the power to revoke a film's licence if it is found to ""endorse support glorify encourage and incite activities that might endanger national security"".ANALYSIS:China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried?EXPLAINER:Hong Kong's year under controversial lawExperts and content producers have raised worries about the impact of the legislation which does not cover films posted online on creativity and freedom of expression.Filmmaker Kiwi Chow whose documentary Revolution of Our Times about the 2019 protests was featured at the Cannes Film Festival this year told Reuters news agency the law would ""worsen self-censorship and fuel fear among filmmakers"".A speedy jobBy Martin Yip BBC News Chinese Hong KongThe bill was passed by a simple showing of hands at the last meeting of the council's much extended current term. And despite the lack of opposition in the legislature lawmakers still debate.Councillor Luk Chung-hung claimed it was political films that hindered creativity not the proposed censorship law. Another councillor Priscilla Leung who is also a law professor insisted the bill was in full compliance with human rights laws and she hoped to stop such films from ""brainwashing"" young people.Filmmakers will certainly be concerned. Dr Kenny Ng of the Hong Kong Baptist University's Film Academy said the new law would see film distributors worrying if their already-approved films would be withdrawn meaning more uncertainty in the industry.As for the lawmakers it is time to prepare for winning their job back as the election takes place in December - under completely new election laws.The arts industry was already being targeted even before the new law. In June a local theatre pulled the award-winning documentary Inside The Red Brick Wall also about the 2019 protests and its distributor lost government funding.Book publishers have admitted to self-censoring and the largest pro-democracy paper Apple Daily closed earlier this year amid a national security investigation.Meanwhile many opposition figures are already in prison or in exile.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media captionThe Hong Kong director standing up to ChinaRelated TopicsChinaFilmHong Kong national security lawHong Kong";Hong Kong passes film censorship law;https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-59047633;mindset;0.930000

"Pegasus row: India's top court orders probe into snooping allegationsPublished9 hours agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage sourceGetty ImagesImage captionAt least 300 Indians were reportedly targeted with phone malware sold to governmentsIndia's top court has appointed an independent panel to investigate allegations that spyware sold to governments was used to hack phones of MPs activists and journalists.The Supreme Court's order followed multiple petitions seeking a probe into allegations of illegal surveillance.The targets' phone numbers were on a database believed to be of interest to clients of Israeli firm NSO.The list was leaked to major news outlets on 18 July.Indian news and opinion website The Wire and The Indian Express newspaper were among the 16 international media outlets which investigated the leaked list and the use of Pegasus spyware around the world.NSO has denied any wrongdoing. It said the software was intended for tracking criminals and terrorists and was only sold to military law enforcement and intelligence agencies from countries with good human rights records.The court has given the committee which will be headed by a former Supreme Court judge eight weeks to investigate the allegations.The revelations about the spyware have raised questions whether the Indian government was illegally snooping on its critics and in some cases even its own ministers.Why Pegasus' snooping threatens India's democracyThe government has called the revelations a ""highly sensational"" global conspiracy.It has maintained that it could not reveal any information on the usage of Pegasus because of of national security issues. However it offered to form a committee of experts to look into the matter and ""dispel any wrong narrative"".On Wednesday the Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said the court was appointing a committee under its supervision to ""probe the falsity and discover [the] truth"" according to Indian website Bar and Bench.The judge said that the alleged violation of privacy needed to be examined as it affected the rights and freedom of people. He added that such technology may also have ""chilling effect"" on press freedom in India.The Pegasus revelations had sparked protests in the country and opposition leaders took up the issue in India's parliament during its monsoon session.Image sourceGetty ImagesImage captionSeveral petitions were filed in India's Supreme Court seeking a probe into the allegationsIt is unclear where the list came from or how many phones were hacked. But of the leaked database of 500000 numbers more than 300 reportedly belong to Indians.Spyware used to target activists leak suggestsPotential targets included main opposition leaders activists and officials.Several activists and journalists including those who were reportedly targeted by the spyware filed pleas seeking answers from the government along with an inquiry headed by a sitting or retired judge of the top court.The petitions were clubbed together by the Supreme Court which began hearing the matter on 5 August.During the hearing of the case the government filed a ""limited affidavit"" claiming the allegations were based on conjecture and that ""there is no substance in the accusations"".Solicitor General Tushar Mehta also argued that such matters cannot be made a matter of public debate. ""No government will make public what software it is using to allow terror networks to modulate its systems and escape tracking"" he said.The court observed that it did not want to compel the government to disclose information about security but only wanted information on whether phones of people had been intercepted.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media captionWhatâs it like to have spyware on your phone?Related TopicsAsiaIndiaCyber-attacksPhone Hacking";India court orders probe into Pegasus snooping row;https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-59059489;mindset;0.930000

"Malkhan Singh: The surrender of India's bandit kingPublished15 hours agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage sourcePrashant PanjiarImage captionMalkhan Singh (sitting at front centre) and his much-feared gang in his home village before surrenderingIn the early 1980s Indian photographer Prashant Panjiar trekked across the arid badlands of central India chronicling the lives of the country's fabled bandits.Most of the bandits lived and operated from Madhya Pradesh state's Chambal region which Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Paul Salopek described as a ""no-go zone of lumpy hills and silty rivers infested with thugs robbers murderers gangsters - with infamous highwaymen called dacoits.""After months of trying Panjiar and two fellow journalists managed to meet Malkhan Singh popularly known as India's ""bandit king"" in Chambal in May 1982.Bandits were also operating with impunity in the neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh: a year ago Phoolan Devi a female bandit had risen to notoriety when she had 22 upper-caste Hindu men massacred on Valentine's Day to avenge her gang-rape.But in Chambal Malkhan Singh and his gang were the most feared. They travelled by foot and lived in makeshift camps in the ravines - deep and narrow gorges with steep sides.At its peak during a 13-year-long reign Singh's gang boasted up to 100 men - he had been crowned the ""bandit king"" by rivals. By 1982 police had registered 94 cases against the gang including for dacoity (banditry) kidnapping and murder.Singh himself according to reports had a reward of 70000 rupees for his capture. Translated at today's rate the reward was just over $900 but in the day it was worth almost $8000 and a pretty big sum. The government also started sending out feelers to him to give up arms.In the blistering summer of 1982 Panjiar and his colleagues Kalyan Mukherjee and Brijraj Singh found themselves at the centre of negotiations between the Congress-led government of Madhya Pradesh and Singh's gang for the latter's surrender. They developed a contact to meet Singh.""I got to spend a few days with the gang. I was happy to be a 'hostage' - their guarantee against betrayal - as long as I was getting my pictures"" Panjiar says.Image sourcePrashant PanjiarImage captionMalkhan Singh's gang moves to the outskirts of a village that was declared a safe haven for surrenderHe first met the gang on a moonless night in Chambal.Panjiar remembers him as a tall and wiry man with a handlebar moustache who was quite reserved and carried a US-made self-loading rifle.""He was a man of few words but an egotist and commanded respect.""The gang which was then about two-dozen-strong moved from one location to another at night carrying their sparse belongings - bedrolls weapons some tarp for protection from rain and simple rations. They slept in the open. One member Panjiar remembers carried an AK-47; others carried carbines and rifles.Panjiar says Singh was a ""classic Chambal story - a  young lower-caste man who said he took up the gun for self-honour and self-protection and to seek vengeance against his tormentor an upper-caste man.""Over nearly a week Panjiar used his Pentax and a borrowed Nikon camera to shoot rolls of film of the gang. Some of these rare pictures appear in his new book That Which Is Unseen.Image sourcePrashant PanjiarImage captionThe gang members at their campImage sourcePrashant PanjiarImage captionMalkhan Singh met government officials before his surrenderImage sourcePrashant PanjiarImage captionA gang member prays to his weapon and an image of a Hindu goddess before his surrenderImage sourcePrashant PanjiarImage captionMalkhan Singh before his surrenderThe surrender finally happened in front of tens of thousands of people in June. Among other conditions Singh had negotiated that none of his gang members could be handed the death penalty.""He came like a conquering hero. Tall and lean dressed in the uniform of the police he had fought hard in for years dacoit king Malkhan Singh's farewell to arms in the town of Bhind in north Madhya Pradesh before an awed crowd of 30000 had all the trappings of a Roman triumph"" reportedIndia Todaymagazine.Singh had a dry sense of humour Panjiar remembers. After his surrender journalists pestered him with a stock question in Hindi:""Aap ko kaisa lag raha hai?(How are you feeling now?)"" Singh would repeat the same line when he met Panjiar and his colleagues.Eventually Malkhan and his gang members were convicted for some of the crimes they'd been charged with and were sent to an ""open jail"" in the state. Singh spent a few years in prison.Now 78 he has pursued a career in politics campaigning in recent years for the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).""I was not a dacoit. I was 'baagi' (rebel) who took up gun for self-honour and self-protection. I know who are real dacoits and also know how to deal with them"" he said in 2019.Prashant Panjiar is a leading Indian photographer and author most recently of That Which Is Unseen (Navajivan Trust)Related TopicsAsiaCrimeIndiaMore on this storyThe singer who preached nonviolence to banditsPublished27 June";The surrender of India's once-feared bandit king;https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-58831394;mindset;0.930000

"Japan's Princess Mako: The woman who gave up royal status to marryPublished1 day agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage sourceEPAImage captionThe couple met at university in 2012When Mako then a Japanese princess announced her engagement to former classmate Kei Komuro in 2017 she said he had won over her heart with ""his bright smiles like the sun"".The two had met five years earlier when they were both university students and shared their plans to wed the following year. It meant the princess would become an ordinary citizen as female imperial family members forfeit their royal status upon marriage to a commoner.Their smiles won over a country where the imperial family is closely scrutinised and its members are expected to be a guardian of traditions. The intense media coverage was mostly positive.But that quickly changed.Two months later the first reports emerged about an alleged money dispute between Mr Komuro's mother and her former fiancÃ© who claimed mother and son had failed to repay a debt to him. Some questioned whether Mr Kumoro could struggle financially in the future.Public perception soured. With the official explanation that the couple needed more time to arrange their ceremony their wedding ended up postponed.Image sourceAFPImage captionThen-Princess Mako speaking with her father mother and sister before leaving for her weddingThe former princess who is now known as Mako Komuro is the first child of the current emperor's younger brother Prince Akishino and his wife Princess Kiko. Born on 23 October 1991 she initially followed royal tradition and attended the elite Gakushuin school where members of the imperial family usually study.But she broke with custom by leaving the institution for her university studies. Ms Mako attended Tokyo's International Christian University where she studied art and cultural heritage and spent a year at the University of Edinburgh. Later she earned a master's degree at the University of Leicester an experience she said was ""wonderful"".People close to Ms Mako described her as an independent and friendly woman who had pursued a career while performing imperial duties a profile by Japan's Kyodo news agency said.She first met Mr Komuro who was also born in 1991 at a meeting of students planning to go abroad in 2012. His humble origins meant that tabloids spent a long time digging dirt on his family. Amid the scandal in 2018 he moved to New York to study law at Fordham University and the couple reportedly kept in touch through the internet.He only came back to Japan last September a return that was not without controversy. Mr Komuro was dressed casually and sporting a ponytail which for many was another proof that he was not fit to marry the then-princess.Finally in October the couple got married. Ms Mako skipped the usual rites associated with a royal wedding and turned down a traditional payment of about $1.3m (Â£940000) given to a female member of the imperial family upon their departure from the household.It was another break from tradition as Ms Mako became the first woman to do so.Questions over Mr Komuro's finances remain despite him saying that the money at the centre of the reports - about $35000 - had been a gift not a loan but that he would pay a settlement. At least one protest was held at their wedding day which included placards saying ""Protect our household"" and ""The imperial family is the soul of Japan"".The excessive press coverage as well as the relentless attacks on social media have had an impact on Ms Mako's mental health and she is now suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder according to the Imperial Household Agency.At a news conference alongside her new husband after their low-key wedding Ms Mako said the ""incorrect"" reports about Mr Komuro had caused her ""great fear stress and sadness"".""Kei is irreplaceable for me"" she said. ""For us marriage is a necessary choice to live while cherishing our hearts.""Mr Komuro who cut off the ponytail before the wedding vowed to protect and support his wife. ""I love Mako"" he said. ""I want to spend the only life I have with the one I love.""The couple are expected to move to the US where Mr Komuro works as a lawyer. The move has drawn comparisons with British royals Meghan Markle and Prince Harry earning the newlyweds the nickname ""Japan's Harry and Meghan"".Ms Mako is expected to remain in Tokyo for some time preparing for the move according to Reuters news agency.

The move has drawn inevitable comparisons with British royals Meghan Markle and Prince Harry earning the newlyweds the nickname ""Japan's Harry and Meghan"".Like Ms Markle Mr Komuro has come under intense scrutiny since his relationship with Ms Mako was announced. He was most recently criticised for sporting a ponytail when he returned to Japan.Some tabloid newspapers and social media users felt his hairstyle - seen as unconventional in Japan - was unbecoming of someone set to marry a princess.There was also a protest on Tuesday against the couple's marriage.'[He] is irreplaceable'In a press conference on Tuesday Ms Mako said she apologised for any trouble brought to people by her marriage.""I am very sorry for the inconvenience caused and I am grateful for those... who have continued to support me"" she said according to an NHK report. ""For me Kei is irreplaceable - marriage was a necessary choice for us.""Mr Komuro added that he loved Ms Mako and wanted to spend his life with her.""I love Mako. We only get one life and I want us to spend it with the one we love"" said Mr Komuro according to an AFP report.  ""I feel very sad that Mako has been in a bad condition mentally and physically because of the false accusations.""Image sourceGetty ImagesPrincess Mako left her Tokyo residence at around 10:00 local time on Tuesday (01:00 GMT) to register her marriage bowing several times to her parents Crown Prince Fumihito and Crown Princess Kiko. She also hugged her younger sister before she left news outlet Kyodo reported.There has been excessive media coverage around the couple over the years which has caused the princess to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder the Imperial Household Agency (IHA) had earlier said.Her relationship has been met with controversy in the country.On Tuesday people were pictured protesting against the marriage in a Japanese park.Many slogans appeared to bring up financial issues around Mr Komuro's family - specifically his mother.Image sourceGetty ImagesThe former princess got engaged to Mr Komuro in 2017 and the two were set to wed the following year. But the marriage was delayed following claims Mr Komuro's mother had financial problems - she had reportedly taken a loan from her ex-fiancÃ© and not paid him back.The palace denied the delay was linked to this though Crown Prince Fumihito said it was important for the money issues to be dealt with before the couple got married.According to the BBC's Tokyo correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes the real reason for the animosity towards Mr Komuro seems to be among some conservative Japanese who believe he is not a worthy partner for a niece of the emperor.Mr Komuro - who has received a job offer from a top New York law firm - comes from humble origins and local tabloids have spent years digging dirt on his family including the allegations against his mother.Analysis: Hideharu Tamura BBC News TokyoThe reaction to Princess Mako and Kei Komuro's relationship by some media and people in Japan has highlighted the pressure women in Japan's imperial family face.The Imperial Household Agency has said Princess Mako suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder because of the harsh criticism from the media and on social media around her engagement since it was announced nearly four years ago.She is not the first woman in the Japanese royal family to be affected this way.Her grandmother Empress Emerita Michiko temporarily lost her voice nearly 20 years ago when criticised by the media as being somehow unfit to be the Emperor's wife. Her aunt-in-law Empress Masako suffered depression after she was blamed for failing to produce a male heir.Royal women have been forced to strictly adhere to certain expectations - they must be supportive of their husbands produce an heir and be a guardian of Japan's traditions. If they fall short they are savagely criticised.This is also true of Princess Mako who said she would give up her royal status.

It is not yet open.That scheme is separate to the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP) that launched on 1 April to resettle people who worked for the UK in Afghanistan.Resettling Afghans in UK will take time - PatelAfghan refugees: Those who worked for UK can stay permanentlyThe BBC has spoken to Afghans who are waiting to find out if they will be eligible for the scheme one who talks about his family home being raided by the Taliban and another who reports family members being threatened.All their names have been changed to protect their anonymity.Mohammed who is in hiding in Afghanistan is an alumnus of the Chevening scholarship scheme the government programme that funds masters degrees at UK universities for foreign students with leadership potential.In August he and other Chevening alumni were told they - and current scholars - would be a priority for the first wave of evacuations and provided the UK government with their details.But they are not sure if they will be eligible for the new ACRS scheme.He told the BBC: ""The fact that it has taken so long is one concern but the fact we don't even know if we will be considered for the scheme is a bigger concern for us.""He fears that ""the more we wait the more in danger we are the more risk we face"" and worries that because Chevening scholars and alumni were previously prioritised for evacuation they have been identified as a group with a strong affiliation to the UK.""It's been more than a month now that I and many other Chevening alumni like me are hiding in our houses and we are fearing persecution if we step out.""We are trying to limit our interactions - we have had very limited interaction with our friends and relatives.""He added that if ""you go out and you talk to someone and they find you - it's over for you"".""If I stay here - that's the end of life. I can't go out I can't get a job I can't work study - nothing at all. That's something to think about later. Right now - it's our lives that are in danger.""Other waiting Afghans express fearsAminais also a Chevening alumni and feels particularly at risk from the Taliban because of her work as a women's rights campaigner and because she is from the Hazara community - an ethnic group who have been persecuted.""The thing that makes me really worried is that they know about my identity my background in Afghanistan and my work experience. I'm a Chevening scholar alumni before I was a women's rights advocate.""Amina was contacted by the Home Office in the summer - identified as an individual at risk - and provided them with all the details of her and her dependents. But she says she hasn't heard back from the UK government since mid-August.Ahmadworked for the Afghan government security services and is currently hiding in Afghanistan. He shared videos with BBC News that show his family home after being raided by the Taliban.He received an email on 20 August from the Foreign Office asking for his details but he has not heard from them since.""On the fourth day of the Taliban in Kabul we left our home and hid in a safe and secret place since then because my mother was also an adviser to the intelligence service department of Afghanistan.""He said his ""main fear"" is that the Taliban will arrest torture or kill former government employees.Image sourceReutersImage captionA Taliban fighter stands guard at the market in KabulAlialso worked for the Afghan government and gave his details to the Home Office one and a half months before leaving Afghanistan but had no response. After Kabul fell to the Taliban he fled to a third country gave the Home Office his details and was told he was a priority for evacuation - but has not had contact since.His family are still in Afghanistan and he says they have been threatened by the Taliban.""Every single or every two days they are going to our offices to our homes to find us or to find one of our family members. Every single day I worry about their lives about their security.""I fought many years against the Taliban - it was also about ISIS al-Qaeda who were a big worry for Afghanistan and a big worry for the world.""The world did not remain a good soldier and a good friend to Afghanistan. Especially to people like me who were in the frontline and who were defending the world from terrorism.""Ms Nandy said: ""Many of them [Afghans waiting to hear] are people who helped us British nationals or the dependents of those who helped us - who are now being targeted by the Taliban and in some cases hunted door to door"" she said.She said when Parliament was recalled in August the ""only concrete commitment"" the prime minister and former foreign secretary Dominic Raab made was ""to respond to every email from members of parliament raising urgent cases of people who were stranded in Afghanistan"".She said: ""They promised to do that by the beginning of September that promise was not met now the Foreign Office is writing to MPs asking them not to raise cases any more and signposting them to a scheme run by the Home Office that isn't even open yet.""She has written to the new foreign secretary to ask her to ""get a grip on the mess that she was left when she took office"".Foreign Affairs committee chair Tom Tugendhat said: ""Those who stood with us now need us to stand with them but every day of delay costs lives. We've been pressing the government for clarity urgently to protect our friends and their families.""In the Commons Conservative MP Caroline Nokes said Afghans who had arrived in the UK were ""desperately"" looking for information on how the ACRS was going to work to help family members join them.And Green Party MP Caroline Lucas told the BBC that when she told the Foreign Office about British nationals still stranded she was met with ""deafening silence"".""Of the seven British nationals I have been in contact with who are still in Afghanistan none of them according to the responses I've received were actually registered with the FCDO as being British nationals stranded in Afghanistan"" she said.""This is despite me sending multiple messages to the FCDO and Home Office and most of the British nationals also making enquiries directly themselves to the FCDO contact points in the public domain.""One former ambassador to Afghanistan Sir Nick Kay said he has ""daily"" requests from Afghans in hiding ""in very perilous situations"" asking for help: ""At the moment all I can do is point them towards the Home Office website for the ACRS.""Very high up on the screen there is the simple statement that 'this scheme is not yet operational'.""There is no date for when they can apply. And there is no clarity for the criteria there will be for the scheme.""So really I feel frustrated but more than that these Afghans feel incredibly at risk their lives have been turned upside down they would just like some clarity from the UK government a clear timeframe and some action rather than just the words.""Related TopicsElizabeth TrussMore on this storyPatel: I don't believe Taliban on women's rightsPublished18 AugustAfghans who worked for UK can stay permanentlyPublished1 September";'The more we wait the more in danger we are';https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-59036894;mindset;0.930000
"Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong convicted and fined on drug chargesPublished1 day agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage sourceGetty ImagesImage captionLee Jae-yong had just been released on parole in August after serving a jail term for other chargesSamsung heir Lee Jae-yong has been convicted and fined for illegally using the sedative propofol.The embattled businessman had taken the drug commonly used as anaesthesia dozens of times in recent years.Under South Korean law recipients of a controlled drug can be prosecuted as well as those who administer it.The controversial heir had just been released on parole in August having spent 20 months in jail for bribery and embezzlement convictions.During his latest trial prosecutors said that Lee used propofol multiple times between 2015 and 2020 under the guise of skin treatment.But his lawyer claimed it was to treat psychological stress related to the hospitalisation of his father and his ongoing legal proceedings. Lee pleaded guilty to the charges.On Tuesday a court fined him 70 million won ($59000 Â£43000). As propofol is less likely to be misused than many other controlled substances offenders typically receive fines rather than jail terms.While it is more commonly used to sedate patients undergoing surgery propofol is also sometimes used recreationally. The singer Michael Jackson was found to have died from a propofol overdose in 2009.'Semiconductors and vaccines'Lee was sentenced for two and a half years in January for his role in bribing the country's former President Park Geun-hye in one of the biggest corruption scandals South Korea had seen in recent years.But he was released early in August this year with the presidential office saying it hoped under his leadership Samsung would help the country produce ""semiconductors and vaccines"".The company subsequently pledged to invest 240 trillion won ($206 billion Â£150 billion) in the next three years in fields such as chips and biopharmaceuticals.Lee himself has kept a low profile as he remains on trial for other charges. He is accused of stock-price manipulation and accounting fraud related to the $8bn merger of two Samsung firms in 2015.You may also be interested in...This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media captionSamsung protester Kim-Yong-hee lives on a traffic tower 20m high and only 150cm wideRelated TopicsSamsungSouth KoreaMore on this storySamsung heir gets prison term for bribery scandalPublished18 January";Samsung heir convicted and fined on drug charges;https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59046707;mindset;0.930000
"President Xi Jinping marks China's 50th anniversary at UNPublished1 day agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage sourceReutersImage captionMr Xi repeated calls for global cooperation at the UNChina's president Xi Jinping marked the country's 50 years of membership in the UN with a speech calling for greater global cooperation.Mr Xi addressed the conference via video link calling for global cooperation on issues like terrorism and cybersecurity.He did not mention Taiwan.China was a founding member of the UN as the Republic of China before the government was ousted by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).The rulers of the Republic of China fled to Taiwan and it was this government that was recognised by the UN as the representatives of China.But Taiwan lost its seat at the UN after the People's Republic of China- a permanent member of the UN security council - was admitted in 1971.China sees Taiwan as a breakaway province while Taiwan claims to be a free and independent country.Five things in China's past shaping Xi's world viewChina: Big spender or loan shark?However China's One China policy asserts that there is only one sovereign Chinese government and that Taiwan is an inseparable part of the country that is to be reunified one day with the mainland.In his speech on Monday delivered via video link Mr Xi said that the decision to ""recognise the representatives of the government of the People's Republic of China as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations ... was a victory for the Chinese people and a victory for people of the world"".There have been rising tensions between China and Taiwan in recent months.China has flown military planes and fighter jets into Taiwan's air defence zone prompting the island's defence minister to say tensions between the two countries were at their worst in 40 years.Taiwan also accuses China of using its role within the UN to prevent Taiwanese delegates from attending conferences by specialised UN agencies therefore denying them access to international cooperation in fields like medical sciences and aviation.What is China's role in the UN?China's influence in the UN has continued to grow since it joined the organization in 1971.In 2018 China became one of the largest financial contributors to the UN. Its contribution rose to 12% of the UN budget in 2019 from 7.9% in 2018 making it second only to the US at 22% and surpassing Japan at 9.7%.In recent years a growing number of key roles in the organization like the Head of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) have been staffed by Chinese nationals.China has also been accused by critics of using its clout within the organisation to rally support for its treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang province.You may also like...This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media captionRos Atkins onâ¦ China-Taiwan TensionsRelated TopicsAsiaChinaMore on this storyFive things shaping China's view of the worldPublished2 days agoChina: Big spender or loan shark?Published29 September";Xi Jinping marks China's 50th anniversary at UN;https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-59033169;mindset;0.930000
"India: Facebook struggles in its battle against fake newsSoutik BiswasIndia correspondentPublished1 day agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage sourceGetty ImagesImage captionWith more than 300 million users India is Facebook's biggest market""I've seen more images of dead people in the past three weeks than I've seen in my entire life"" a Facebook researcher in India wrote in 2019 after following recommendations by the social network's algorithms for three weeks.The researcher's report was part of a cache of internal documents called The Facebook Papers recently obtained by New York Times and other US publications. They show the social media giant struggling to tame the avalanche of fake news hate speech and inflammatory content -""celebrations of violence"" among other things - out of India the network's biggest market.This was made worse reported theNew York Times by failure to deploy enough resources in India's 22 officially recognised languages and a lack of cultural sensitivity.A Facebook spokesperson told me that the findings had led the company to undertake a ""deeper more rigorous analysis"" of its recommendation systems in India and contributed to ""product changes to improve them"".So is a lack of resources hobbling efforts by Facebook to fight fake news and inflammatory material in India? Facebook has partnered locally with 10 fact-checking organisations. Items flagged across the social network are fact-checked in English and 11 other Indian languages making it one of the largest networks after the US.But the reality is more complex. Fact-checking organisations working with Facebook in India say they cross-check and tag suspicious news and posts flagged by users. The network is then expected to suppress the distribution of such posts.""We really do not have any moral or legal authority on what Facebook does after we tag a news or a post"" a senior official of a fact-checking organisation told me.Image sourceAFPImage captionPrime Minister Modi and Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg in 2015Also fact-checking is only one part of Facebook's efforts at countering misinformation. The problem in India is much bigger: hate speech is rife bots and fake accounts linked to India's political parties and leaders abound and user pages and large groups brim with inflammatory material targeting Muslims and other minorities. Disinformation is an organised and carefully mined operation here. Elections and ""events"" like natural calamities and the coronavirus pandemic usually trigger fake news outbreaks.Also the fact that Facebook does not fact check opinion and speech posted by politicians on grounds of ""free expression and respect for the democratic process"" is not always helpful. ""A large part of the misinformation on social media in India is generated by politicians of the ruling party. They have the largest clout but Facebook doesn't fact-check them"" says Pratik Sinha co-founder of Alt News an independent fact-checking site.Is Facebook favouring the ruling BJP in India?So the latest revelations do not come as a surprise to most fact-checkers and rights activists in India. ""We have known this all along. No social media platform is above blame"" says Mr Sinha.With a surfeit of hate speech trolling and attacks on minorities and women Indian Twitter is a polarised and dark place. WhatsApp the Facebook-owned messaging service remains the largest carrier of fake news and hoaxes in its biggest market. YouTube owned by Google hosts a lot of fake news and controversial content but doesn't attract the same amount of attention. For example there were live videos up to 12 hours long on the site that fanned conspiracy theories about thedeath of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajputlast year. (The police later ruled that Rajput died by suicide.)Image sourceAFPImage captionMany inflammatory videos on the 2019 Delhi riots were posted on FacebookThe problem with Facebook lies elsewhere. With 340 million users India is its biggest market. It is a general purpose social media platform which offers users individual pages and to form groups. ""The wide range of features make it more vulnerable to all kinds of misinformation and hate speech"" says Mr Sinha.The overwhelming bulk of hate speech and misinformation on the social network are expected to be captured by its internal AI engines and content moderators all over the world. Facebook claims to have spent more than $13bn and hired more than 40000 people in teams and technology around the world on safety and security issues since 2016. More than 15000 people review content in more than 70 languages including 20 Indian languages a spokesperson told me.When users report hate speech automated ""classifiers"" - a database created by humans which annotates different kinds of speeches - vet them before selected ones reach human moderators which are often third-party contractors. ""If these classifiers were good enough they would catch a lot more hate speech with fewer false positives. But they clearly aren't"" says Mr Sinha.A Facebook spokesperson told that the firm had ""invested significantly in technology to find hate speech in various languages including Hindi and Bengali"".""As a result we've reduced the amount of hate speech that people see by half this year. Today it's down to 0.05%. Hate speech against marginalised groups including Muslims is on the rise globally. So we are improving enforcement and are committed to updating our policies as hate speech evolves online"" the spokesperson said.Then there are allegations that Facebook favours the governing party. Aseries of articlesby journalists Cyril Sam and Paranjoy Guha Thakurta in 2018 wrote about the platform's ""dominant position in India with more than a little help from friends of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP"" among other things. (The articles also looked at the Congress party's own ""relations with Facebook"".) ""A business model predicated on virality makes Facebook an ally of ruling governments"" says Mr Guha Thakurta co-author of The Real Face of Facebook in India.Many believe a large part of the blame must broadly lie with the social network's algorithms which decide what to show up when you search for a subject and pushes users to join groups watch videos and explore new pages.Alan Rusbridger a journalist and member of Facebook's oversight board has said the board will have to ""get to grips"" with the perception of people who believe that ""the algorithms rewardemotional content that polarises communitiesbecause that makes it more addictive"". In other words the network's algorithms allow ""fringe content to reach the mainstream"" as Roddy Lindsay a former data scientist at Facebook says.""This ensures that these feeds will continue promoting the most titillating inflammatory content and it creates an impossible task for content moderators who struggle to police problematic viral content in hundreds of languages countries and political contexts""notesMr Lindsay.In the end as Frances Haugen the Facebook product-manager-turned-whistleblower says: ""We should have software that is human-scaled where humans have conversations together not computers facilitating who we get to hear from.""Related TopicsIndiaMore on this storyThe journalist jailed for Facebook postsPublished22 December 2018Is Facebook favouring the ruling BJP in India?Published17 August 2020The Indian government's war with TwitterPublished12 FebruaryIndia net neutrality may be strongestPublished30 November 2017Why is Mark Zuckerberg angry?Published29 December 2015";India Facebook is full of fake news and dead bodies;https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-59006615;mindset;0.930000
"Fleeing Afghanistan: 'Women are imprisoned while the criminals are free'By Claire PressBBC World ServicePublished1 day agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingWhen Afghanistan fell to the Taliban hundreds of female judges went into hiding. The Taliban had opened prisons across the country freeing the very men the judges once incarcerated.Twenty-six of those women have now escaped to Greece and the BBC travelled there to meet them. For their safety their names have been changed.Image captionJudge Sana in her temporary accommodation in Greece. She would never stop fighting for the rights of women in Afghanistan she said.Close to midnight the phone rang. With the pick-up location confirmed it was time to leave.Dressed in a full-length black chador Judge Sana stepped into the street her two young children hovering by her side. Each of them was carrying a single bag stuffed with two sets of clothes a passport phone cash and as much food as they could carry for the journey ahead.""When we left we didn't know where we were going"" Sana recalled. ""We were told there would be security risks on the way but we accepted them all because we knew this was the only way out.""A car arrived to collect her and her children. As she climbed in Sana looked back at the city where she had been born raised and begun her own family. Whether they survived was now in the hands of strangers coordinating an evacuation effort. She had no idea where they were going but she knew they couldn't stay.""It was the worst moment of my life when I looked at my kids while leaving"" she said. ""I was so hopeless. I wondered whether I would ever get them out of Afghanistan alive.""For the past three months Sana said she has been hunted by the very men she sent to prison for violent crimes against women. The Taliban opened prisons as they advanced across the country freeing thousands of criminals to take revenge on those who incarcerated them.""I worked in a court that dealt with lots of different crimes including murder suicide rape and other complex crimes. The punishments I delivered were long and serious"" Sana said.""But after they were all released every one of them told us: 'We will kill you if we find you.'""Image captionJudge Sana fled Afghanistan with her two children and just four bags between them.A recent BBC investigation found that more than220 female judges were living in hidingbecause they feared retribution under Taliban rule. Speaking from secret locations inside Afghanistan many of those women said they were receiving death threats on a daily basis.In response to the accusations secretary to the Taliban spokesman Bilal Karimi told the BBC: ""Female judges should live like any other family without fear. No-one should threaten them. Our special military units are obliged to investigate such complaints and act if there is a violation.""Karimi also repeated the Taliban's promise of a ""general amnesty"" for all former government workers across Afghanistan.But Sana described the past few months as a ""living nightmare"".""We were changing locations every two to three days moving from the street to safehouses and hotels"" she said.""We couldn't go back. Our own house had already been raided.""EvacuatedAfter leaving the pick-up point Sana and her family continued the next leg of their journey overland. They travelled through the desert for more than 10 hours she said never sleeping. Every half an hour or so they would arrive at a Taliban checkpoint where armed men would inspect the travellers.Sana cradled her youngest child in her arms the entire way she said. She didn't think they would make it out alive.""If they knew I was a judge they would have killed us immediately"" she said breaking down in tears. Sana had often ruled over cases where women had killed themselves due to their husband's abuse.""I always used to think at what point does a woman choose death? But as I began to lose hope I reached this point. I was ready to kill myself.""After safely making it across the desert Sana and her children spent more than a week in a safehouse until finally they were taken to an airstrip.As the plane took off the entire cabin broke down in tears she said. They were out.Image captionThe temporary apartments in Greece were simple kitted out with bunk beds a table and chairs.RefugeAfter arriving in Athens all 26 judges and their family members were tested for Covid-19 before being dropped off at various apartment blocks around the city. Under a temporary visa scheme the judges were guaranteed food and shelter by the Greek authorities in conjunction with various charities for 14 days.What would happen after the two weeks were up was unknown. The judges were advised to start applying for asylum in a third country.Among those applying for refuge in the UK was Asma. With more than 25 years' experience as a judge in Afghanistan this was not the first time she had fled the Taliban.In 1996 when the group seized power from the retreating Soviet army Asma and her family fled over the border out of Afghanistan.""This is the second time we've experienced a Taliban takeover. I was a judge when they first came to power"" said Asma.""Even then female judges were the first to be ousted from society.""With the arrival of the US and NATO troops in 2001 Asma returned home and resumed work as a judge. Until two months ago history began to repeat itself.Image captionStorm Ballos brings thunder and lightening over the Acropolis of Athens Greece earlier this monthSana too had witnessed the rise of the Taliban before. She had only just graduated from law school when they swept to power in the nineties. For five years she was forced to stay home and forego work she said.""Becoming a female judge in itself is a huge fight"" she said. ""First she has to convince her own family to let her study. Then even when she goes to university and gets a job she still has to prove herself every step of the way.""But female judges are needed in Afghanistan to understand the pain women are in. Like a doctor is needed to cure the sick a female judge understands the hardships women face and she can help to solve inequality.""For women there is shame associated with even reporting a crime. But families are more likely to support their female relatives if there is a female judge present.""Those left behindPacing the walls of her tiny temporary apartment in Greece Sana scrolled on her phone. She pointed to a picture of her old family home a property which she said proudly was hers by law not her husband's.After their evacuation the house was commandeered by a high-ranking member of the Taliban she said. He lives in her home drives her car possesses all of her belongings.For the judges now living as a part of the diaspora news from back home is rarely positive. In one of their many Whatsapp groups a montage of 28 profile pictures is being shared. Every face one judge said was a former male prosecutor allegedly assassinated in the past 48 hours by criminals released from prison.Image captionSana in her Greek accommodation. Every day the authorities bring cooked food for the families to reheat and share.Of all the women judges who made it to Greece it was the younger ones who seemed the most broken by what they had to leave behind.Nargis a junior judge served for less than five years in a provincial family court before the Taliban takeover. Her entire university and working career took place under a US-backed Afghan government.""While the Taliban are in power it will be impossible for women to progress and to hold on to all they had achieved in the past 20 years"" Nargis said.Among the older judges those who had witnessed not only the rise but also the fall of the Taliban before there was more hope.""The women of Afghanistan are not the women of 20 years ago"" said Asma. ""Look at those women who protested on the first days when the Taliban arrived; asking for their rights asking for an education.""Even getting to this stage has not been easy. But today every daughter of our country is on her feet.""Image captionRecently arrived in Greece Nargis looks out across the citySana has found her own hope too. The laws she and her fellow female judges helped forge cannot simply be deleted from history she said. They may be ignored by the Taliban but they cannot be erased. They are searchable sharable - a record of what was achieved.She quoted from the constitution. Article 22: All citizens of Afghanistan man and woman have equal rights. Article 43: Education is the right of all citizens of Afghanistan. Article 48: Work is the right of every Afghan.Sana had helped draft the Elimination of Violence Against Women act which was passed into law in 2009 and made 22 acts of abuse toward women criminal offences including rape battery forced marriage preventing women from acquiring property and prohibiting a woman or girl from going to school or work.For now the Taliban have decreed that all working women and female students must stay home from school or work until all workplaces and learning environments are deemed ""safe"". They have said it is a temporary measure but are yet to set out a timeline for when the situation will change.Asked whether women would hold prominent roles such as judge or minister in the future Mr Karimi told the BBC he could not comment because ""the working conditions and opportunities for women"" were ""still being discussed"".From her new temporary shelter in Greece Sana sees a painful injustice back home.""Right now women are stuck in their houses and the criminals I put away are free"" she said.She vowed she would continue to fight that injustice even from abroad and ""support every Afghan woman"".""Afghanistan does not belong to the Taliban or any one specific group'' she said. ""It belongs to every Afghan.""Photographs by Derrick Evans.Related TopicsAfghanistanWomen's rights in AfghanistanWomen's rightsTalibanMore on this storyFemale Afghan judges hunted by the murderers they convictedPublished28 SeptemberGirls excluded as Afghan secondary schools reopenPublished18 September";'Women are imprisoned and the criminals are free';https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-59009470;mindset;0.930000
"The Indian women widowed by Covid-19By Medhavi AroraBBC reporter IndiaPublished1 day agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsCoronavirus pandemicImage sourceTaruna AroraImage captionTaruna and her husband Rajeev. They had been married for 22 years when he diedTaruna Arora lost her husband Rajeev to Covid-19 two days before his 50th birthday.Rajeev contracted the virus in April during India's devastating second Covid wave. Medical resources were scarce hospitals overwhelmed and his family struggled to get him admitted. They finally found a hospital bed in a makeshift facility set up by the government but two weeks later he died.""Rajeev's death is paralysing. These are the worst days of my life but I have no time to grieve because my life has taken a 360 degree turn"" says Taruna 46. Rajeev who worked in the telecom sector was the sole bread winner of the family and took most of the financial decisions. Now Taruna is relying on their savings and her limited knowledge of finances to support their two children.""We always led a comfortable life and I got everything I asked for. He did all the budgeting and I just asked him for money. Now I don't know how long our savings will last because I've never managed them myself"" says Taruna.She hopes to find a job to support the children but has no work experience and doesn't know where to start. ""I just want to find a job leave the house meet people and have a cup of tea with someone. When I'm at home the pain won't let me sleep.""Image sourceGetty ImagesImage captionCovid has so far killed over 450000 people in India according to government figuresIndia has been one of the world's worst Covid-hit nations recording more than 450000 official deaths so far. The pandemic has left tens of thousands of women newly widowed struggling to adjust to a new life.Many of these women have never worked in a paying job before.According to the World Bank India's female labour force participation rate - which was less than 21% in 2019 - is one of the lowest in the world.Many have lost the sole bread winner of their families and as their worlds changed overnight they are struggling to manage the double burden of grief and financial difficulties. Gender roles and patriarchal norms at home mean they were financially dependent on their male partners and have been excluded from financial services.In 2017 Indian women were nearly 13% less likely than men to be able to raise funds in case of an emergency according to the World Bank.Indian women were also 6% less likely than men to have a bank account- a problem that's only made worse by the fact thatIndian women are also significantly less likely than men to own a mobile phone or use mobile internet.This makes it harder for women like Taruna to access compensation - such as the recent announcement by the Indian government to pay a sum of 50000 rupees ($674; Â£500) to the families of those who died of Covid-19.During India's second Covid wave Madhura Dasgupta Sinha a social entrepreneur in Mumbai was raising funds for a classmate a 50-year-old engineer who was Covid positive and needed critical care. Sadly he died but the classmates wanted his family to have the funds they had pulled together.Image sourceMadhura Dasgupta SinhaImage captionMadhura Dasgupta Sinha is campaigning to help women dealing with life after the death of their husbandsWhen Madhura asked his wife which account they should credit the funds to she said she didn't know if she had a bank account. ""There was no knowledge in the family on what to do financially when tragedy hits but this was not the time to teach her internet banking or financial prudence"" says Madhura 51 an ex-banker.Seeing this Madhura launched Not Alone a campaign to help women who had lost the sole bread winners of their families to the pandemic. After the launch she saw a huge uptick in volunteers from India and the Indian diaspora wanting to help.There are about 100 women in the community. Many are struggling with their mental health. Madhura and her team of volunteers have seen cases of depression survivor's guilt and even suicidal tendencies. Others are struggling to make ends meet.""Some of these women are facing inheritance issues for others the in-laws are not letting them stay on in the marital home. Sometimes the deceased member's workplace makes a generous settlement but they find they have newfound relatives descending on them"" says Madhura.""Many are struggling to pay their children's school fees. In one case the person didn't know how insurance works and she still paid the premium after her husband's death.""Image sourceGetty ImagesImage captionIn India 27% of men are financially literate while the figure for women is 20% says S&PThe root cause she adds is poor financial literacy. Globally 35% of men are financially literate compared to 30% of women according to a 2015 survey by ratings agency Standard and Poor's (S&P).But in India financial literacy is lower and the gender gap is wider with 27% of men financially literate compared to 20% of women.Madhura and her team encourage the women to re-enter the workforce but some are not ready. For such cases grief counselling becomes a priority and the process is not a linear one. Weeks of emotional progress is sometimes set back by a simple trigger that can come in the form of a picture or a snippet of conversation.Those who are ready are slowly nudged towards employment and are provided with career guidance and support. Many of the women have projects they are passionate about and the volunteers help grow these into small businesses.Some start-ups have even approached Madhura saying they actively want to hire from this community and 12 women have already found their first jobs and others are in the pipeline.With the right support Madhura's classmate's wife was able to open a bank account. She received some funds from well-wishers but needed a sustainable source of income. Madhura and her team wanted to help her but hit a roadblock. Even though she was offered a job her classmate's wife declined saying she was too emotionally drained. Madhura waited patiently and finally one day she called back.""She is now investing wisely has learnt internet banking and set up remittances for her daughter's education. These are all very small things but to us it's a huge win.""Related TopicsWomen in IndiaAsiaLifeIndiaLifestyleCoronavirus pandemic";The Indian women widowed by Covid-19;https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58149183;mindset;0.930000

Total vaccinations refers to the number of doses given not the number of people vaccinated. It is possible to have more than 100 doses per 100 population as some vaccines require multiple doses per person.Source: Our World in DataLast updated: 25 October 2021 11:12 BSTOverall China and India have administered the highest number of doses with around 2.2 billion and one billion respectively. The US ranks third with more than 410 million.But when breaking the figures down by doses per 100 people in countries with a population of at least one million Cuba the United Arab Emirates and Uruguay top the list.Most countries are prioritising the over-60s health workers and people who are clinically vulnerable.Some countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine.How fast is vaccination progress around the world?Where are cases still high?The number of daily cases is stable or falling in most regions except Europe.AsiaAsia which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020 has seen cases falling in recent weeks.In India where the number of new daily cases has fallen dramatically since May the official death toll is more than 450000 and it has recorded more than 34 million cases - second only to the US.Latin AmericaIn Latin America Brazil has recorded more than 21 million cases and more than 600000 deaths - the world's second highest official death toll.Mexico has seen the fourth highest number of deaths in the world with more than 280000.There have been nearly 200000 deaths in Peru which has seen the highest number of deaths by population size - more than 600 deaths for every 100000 people.EuropeSeveral European countries have seen a rise in cases recently driven by theDelta variantof the virus including Russia Romania Serbia Bulgaria and Ukraine.The UK has one of thehighest rates of covid infection in Europebut its relatively high level of vaccination has greatly reduced the number of hospitalisations and deaths.North AmericaThe US has recorded almost 45 million cases and over 720000 deaths - the highest figures in the world.The death rate in Canada is far lower than its neighbour's but it has recently seen a rise in the number of daily cases.Middle EastSeveral countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus.The official death toll in Iran - the Middle East's worst-hit country - has passed 120000 but confirmed case numbers are now falling.Israel has rolled out a highly successful vaccination programme. Cases are now falling after a recent spike in numbers.Daily cases in the West Bank and Gaza have also dropped after a sharp increase in recent days.AfricaAfrica has seen around 8.5 million cases and more than 215000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic in many African countries is not known as testing rates are low.South Africa with 2.9 million cases and around 90000 deaths is the worst affected country on the continent according to official figures.Morocco has recorded around 940000 cases and Tunisia is not far behind with around 710000.OceaniaAustralia and New Zealand have been praised for their response to the pandemic with both countries having seen comparatively few deaths.Australia has announced that it is toreopen its international borderfrom November restoring the freedom to travel to vaccinated citizens and relatives.New Zealand has also been in lockdown since mid-August though it is recording around 50 cases per day.How did coronavirus spread?Covid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan China in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020.It was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.A pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time.UK LOOK-UP:How many cases in your area?TESTING:What tests are available?SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them?VACCINE:How do I know the Covid vaccine is safe?About this dataThe data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.When comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way.This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.Other factors to consider include: different population sizes the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.The map table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for figures for France and the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University.

Western powers suspended aid and the World Bank and International Monetary Fund also halted payments.A nation is considered aid-dependent when 10% or more of its gross domestic product comes from foreign aid; in Afghanistan's case about 40% of GDP was international aid according to the World Bank.Many Afghans are now selling their possessions to buy food. The new Taliban administration has been blocked from accessing overseas assets as nations assess how to deal with the hardline group meaning wages to civil servants and other workers have been withheld.""It has been more than five months that I have received my wages"" a teacher in Herat told the BBC. ""Life is tough. I am selling whatever we have at home. We are selling our animals cutting our trees to sell the wood.""""People are impoverished here"" said a man in Kandahar.

Basic ingredients like cooking oil and wheat had skyrocketed in price. In October the organisation warned that one million children were at risk of dying from severe acute malnutrition without immediate life-saving treatment.In September more than $1bn (Â£720m) was pledged by the international community at a conference in Geneva to support Afghans with about a third earmarked for the WFP.But according to the WFP on Monday the UN humanitarian assistance programme remains only a third funded. The organisation said it may require as much as $220m (Â£159.6m) per month to meet the task calling the current financial commitments a ""drop in the ocean"".The food crisis in Afghanistan has been compounded by water shortages and a severe drought - the country's second in four years.Related TopicsAfghanistanMore on this storyUS and Taliban discuss aid in direct talksPublished11 OctoberIMF: Afghanistan economic woes to hurt neighboursPublished7 days agoOver $1bn pledged as UN warns of Afghan crisisPublished13 September'I'm like a prisoner': Life in a Taliban cityPublished29 AugustFighting off hunger under the TalibanPublished20 SeptemberUncertain times ahead for Afghan womenPublished17 August";Afghanistan facing desperate food crisis UN warns;https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-59011501;mindset;0.930000

Laws are a reflection of what society desires. The UK for example has laws that reflect what the British people want; Brexit is a reflection of what British people wanted""he told the BBC's Newsday programme.However the BBC's Thomas Naadi reports from Ghana that more than 100 petitions have been submitted against the bill.Nevertheless the bill was likely to pass because the majority of MPs support it he says.Parliamentary speaker Alban Bagbin has said that the bill - which still faces months of debate - will undergo a thorough and transparent process before MPs vote on it.What prompted the bill?Named ""Promotion of Proper Human Sexual Rights and Ghanaian Family Values"" the bill was mooted months after Ghana's first LGBT community centre opened in January.The venue in the capital Accra was later closed by police after public protests.A UN human rights expert has said that the bill ""will promote a system of state-sponsored discrimination and violence"" against sexual minorities in Ghana.There is no law in Ghana that says being LGBT is illegal. But same-sex relationships are criminalised by a penal code - introduced by the British when they ruled Ghana - that mentions ""unnatural carnal knowledge"". People found guilty risk three years in prison.The code""is completely vague"" and is rarely enforced but is interpreted by authorities as ""penile penetration of anything other than a vagina"" according to Dr Anima Adjepong a US-based Ghanaian sociologist researching gender sexuality and identity in West Africa.Being gay in Ghana: LGBT community is 'under attack'How has the LGBT community reacted?The Ghana News Agency reported on Monday that police had arrested two people who had been living together for about two months for alleged homosexual activities.However the accused denied the allegations.Campaign group RetifyGhana tweeted that five gay people were also remanded in custody last week denouncing the latest bill as a ""homophobes dream"".""In Ghana homophobia is being promoted by religious political and media personalities. The media especially participates and enables homophobia"" the rights group added in atweet.There are 69 countries that have laws that criminalise homosexuality and nearly half of these are in Africa.However in some countries there have been moves to decriminalise same-sex unions.In February this year Angola's President JoÃ£o LourenÃ§o signed into law a revised penal code to allow same-sex relationships and bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.Related TopicsGhanaLGBTMore on this storyLGBT in Ghana: âWe deserve to be protectedâPublished11 March";Anglican church head condemns Ghana anti-gay bill;https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-59062483;mindset;0.930000

"Sudan coup: Why the army is gambling with the futureBy Alex de WaalAfrica analystPublished13 hours agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsSudan crisisImage sourceAFPSudan's coup leader General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan has taken a leap into the dark.He has endangered Sudan's international standing as a nascent democracy imperilled essential debt relief and international aid and jeopardised peace with rebels in Darfur and the Nuba Mountains.He was head of Sudan's Sovereign Council and the face of the army in the country's civilian-military cohabitation - until Monday when he seized complete power.He dissolved the country's civilian cabinet arresting Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and other prominent civilians with whom the military had agreed to share power until elections were held next year.The general's autocratic ambitions were no secret.Over the last months he showed impatience with Mr Hamdok's leadership signalling that a strong ruler was needed to save the nation.At a recent military-backed demonstration in the capital Khartoum protesters blamed Mr Hamdok for deteriorating living conditions - not helped by a blockade at the main port in the east which has led to shortages.Sudanese democrats were alert to the army's stratagems which seemed to be copied from the playbook that led to Abdul Fatah al-Sisi's military takeover in Egypt in 2013.The Sudan Professionals Association and the multitude of neighbourhood committees that had orchestrated the non-violent protests which brought down the 30-year rule of President Omar al-Bashir in 2019 prepared for a new round of street demonstrations.Image sourceEPAImage captionProtesters are determined not to allow the army to steal the revolution that saw Omar al-Bashir ousted in 2019Foreign diplomats were also worried. US Special Envoy Jeffrey Feldman visited Khartoum at the weekend to press for agreement between the generals and the civilians. He left the city on Sunday with - he thought - a pact agreed.The coup was staged hours later leaving the Americans not only dismayed but outraged.Making it clear that they had been deceived the US administration has ""paused"" a $700m (Â£508m) financial assistance package.An even bigger issue is the status of Sudan's debt relief package recently negotiated by Mr Hamdok.After two years of painful delays international aid to salvage Sudan's economy was finally in prospect - and is now in jeopardy.The African Union (AU) the United Nations the East African regional body Igad and all of Sudan's Western donors have condemned the coup and called for a return to civilian rule.The Arab League has also called for the constitutional formula to be respected. The grouping is usually in step with the Egyptian government raising the question of how much Gen Burhan can count on the backing of Cairo.Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) which provided crucial financial aid to Gen Burhan in 2019 have stayed silent so far.Their sympathies probably lie with the army strongman but they will also know they cannot cover the costs of bailing out Sudan.Gen Burhan was already the most powerful man in the country his role legitimised by the August 2019 power-sharing deal between the military and the Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC) a loose coalition of civilian groups.So why would he risk it all on a blatant power grab?Commercial empiresAccording to that agreement Gen Burhan was due to step down as chairman of the Sovereign Council next month.At that point a civilian chosen by the FFC would become the head of state and the civilians in government would be better placed to push ahead with implementing key items on their agenda.One is accountability for human rights violations. The government is committed in principle to handing over ex-President Bashir to the International Criminal Court (ICC).His former lieutenants - including Gen Burhan and leader of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces Gen Mohamed Hamdan ""Hemeti"" Dagolo - wanted him to be tried in Sudan and not in The Hague.They have good reason to fear that Bashir will name them as culprits in the alleged atrocities meted out during the Darfur war.Gen Burhan and his fellow officers have even more reason to fear that investigation into the massacre in Khartoum in June 2019 would also point the finger of blame in their direction.It took place two months after Bashir's removal by the army when peaceful protesters were calling for civilian rule.Tackling corruption and implementing security sector reform were other agenda items that worried the generals.Take the cumbersomely named ""Commission for Dismantling the June 30 1989 Regime Removal of Empowerment and Corruption and Recovering Public Funds.""This was not only exposing and uprooting the network of companies owned by the Islamists forced out of power in 2019 but also the tentacles of the commercial empires owned by senior generals.Mr Hamdok had become increasingly outspoken in his criticism of the military entanglement in the economy.Not only was the army commanding a vast - and still-increasing - share of the national budget but military-owned companies operate with tax exemptions and often allegedly corrupt contracting procedures.Placing the army under proper civilian control was also a priority for the next stage of the transitional period.Risk of rebel actionGen Burhan is claiming he is keeping the transition to democracy on track - and has promised a technocratic civilian government and elections in two years.Most Sudanese see this as an unconvincing faÃ§ade.The crackdown has dissolved the key trade unions and professional groups that organised the previous street protests. Internet and social media are largely shut down. Troops have fired on protesters reportedly killing 10.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media captionDemonstrators take to the streets of Khartoum to protest against the arrestsStreet activists have overcome such clampdowns before and forced the army to back down most notably in the aftermath of the June 2019 killings.The generals must also face the reality that the civil war in parts of the country is not over.A peace agreement last year brought several armed opposition groups into government - but no deal was yet reached with the biggest two rebel forces.Image sourceAFPImage captionGen Burhan (L) and civilian PM Hamdok (R) were part of a power-sharing administrationIn Darfur there is the Sudan Liberation Movement headed by Abdel Wahid al-Nur and in the Nuba Mountains of South Kordofan there is the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North led by Abdel Aziz al-Hilu.Both command popular support and have shown military resilience. Both were in peace talks with the government and had confidence in Mr Hamdok. The coup threatens renewed conflict.With his unconstitutional seizure of power Gen Burhan has taken a huge gamble.He is offering no answers to Sudan's most pressing issues - the economy democratisation and peace - and is risking turmoil and bloodshed at home and pariah status abroad.In July 2019 following the army's violent crackdown on the democracy movement the ""quartet"" of the US the UK Saudi Arabia and the UAE working hand-in-glove with the AU stepped in to press for a negotiated solution - which followed the next month.A similar process may be needed to bring Sudan back from the brink. The problem is after Monday who can trust Gen Burhan to keep his word?Alex de Waal is the executive director of the World Peace Foundation at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in the US.More on the Sudan coup:IN PICTURES:Sudan coup protesters take to streetsEXPLAINER:Sudan coup: What you need to knowANALYSIS:Sounding the alarm for Sudanâs democracyRelated TopicsSudan crisisAbdel Fattah al-BurhanSudanMore on this storyA quick guide to SudanPublished9 September 2019Around the BBCAfrica Today podcasts";Why the army is gambling with Sudan's future;https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-59050473;mindset;0.930000

The US the UK EU UN and African Union of which Sudan is a member have all demanded the immediate release of all arrested political leaders which includes members of Mr Hamdok's cabinet.UN chief Antonio Guterres said Sudan was among an ""epidemic of coups d'etats"" affecting Africa and Asia and he urged the world's ""big powers"" to band together for ""effective deterrence"" through the UN Security Council.Meanwhile the US has halted $700m (Â£508m) in aid to Sudan and the EU has threatened to do the same. Both are demanding the restoration of the civilian government without preconditions.Since Monday troops are reported to have been going house to house in Khartoum arresting local protest organisers.Our correspondent says thousands more people have joined the protests in the capital mainly in residential neighbourhoods near the city centre.The city's airport is closed and all flights are cancelled until Saturday.Staff at the country's central bank have reportedly gone on strike and doctors across Sudan are said to be refusing to work in military-run hospitals except in emergencies.Image sourceAFPImage captionProtesters have been chanting slogans against the militaryCivilian leaders and their military counterparts have been at odds since long-time ruler Omar al-Bashir was overthrown in 2019.A power-sharing agreement between civilian and military leaders was designed to steer Sudan towards democracy but has proven fragile with a number of previous coup attemptsthe last just over a month ago.Gen Burhan who was head of the power-sharing council said Sudan was committed to the transition to civilian rule with elections planned for July 2023.Are you in Sudan?

I am raising her child alone no-one has asked about their well-being not even the government.""'We can't afford lawyers'Ms Wanjiru who dropped out of high school and later became a sex worker to look after her baby was last seen by witnesses on the night of 31 March 2012.She was walking out of a Nanyuki bar accompanied by two British soldiers.Her body was later discovered behind a room where the soldiers had stayed with missing body parts and a stabbing injury.Kenyan judge Njeri Thuku concluded after an inquest in 2019 that Ms Wanjiru had been murdered by one or two British soldiers.She ordered two further criminal inquiries but the military took no action the Sunday Times reports.A soldier told the paper that the killer had confessed to him and he had reported it but the army had failed to initially investigate.Kenyan detectives are also said to have asked British military police to question some of the soldiers but the UK's defence ministry denied receiving such a request.On Tuesday UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the Ministry of Defence (MOD) had fully co-operated with the Kenyan investigation - and would continue to do so.Image sourceAFPImage captionThe British army holds training exercises near NanyukiMr Muchiri said the family felt let down but could not afford legal representation to take the matter further.""You know we are poor.

Some of the remains were believed to be of children as young as three.The landmark Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) report released in 2015 detailed sweeping failures in the care and safety of these children and complicity by the church and government.""Government church and school officials were well aware of these failures and their impact on student health"" the authors wrote.

""Having my records expunged will mean something to my grandchildren and great grandchildren. And it will mean something for other black children.""Speaking to a crowd of relatives and activists in Montgomery she said: ""I guess you can say that now I am no longer a juvenile delinquent.""CONTEXT:Before Rosa Parks there was a 15-year-old girlLONG READ:The black migrant who fought US segregationIn an interview with the BBC in 2018 Ms Colvin said she ""was not frightened but disappointed and angry"" because she knew she ""was sitting in the right seat"".She was the first person to be arrested for challenging Montgomery's bus segregation policies but her story remains relatively unknown. It was Rosa Parks who became one of the main figures of the civil rights movement after her case led to the boycott of the bus system.Ms Colvin said she had been inspired by the great anti-slavery campaigners Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth. She would end up testifying in the landmark case that effectively ended segregation on buses in 1956.Her lawyer said the probation had cast a shadow over her life.

Laws are a reflection of what society desires. The UK for example has laws that reflect what the British people want; Brexit is a reflection of what British people wanted""he told the BBC's Newsday programme.However the BBC's Thomas Naadi reports from Ghana that more than 100 petitions have been submitted against the bill.Nevertheless the bill was likely to pass because the majority of MPs support it he says.Parliamentary speaker Alban Bagbin has said that the bill - which still faces months of debate - will undergo a thorough and transparent process before MPs vote on it.What prompted the bill?Named ""Promotion of Proper Human Sexual Rights and Ghanaian Family Values"" the bill was mooted months after Ghana's first LGBT community centre opened in January.The venue in the capital Accra was later closed by police after public protests.A UN human rights expert has said that the bill ""will promote a system of state-sponsored discrimination and violence"" against sexual minorities in Ghana.There is no law in Ghana that says being LGBT is illegal. But same-sex relationships are criminalised by a penal code - introduced by the British when they ruled Ghana - that mentions ""unnatural carnal knowledge"". People found guilty risk three years in prison.The code""is completely vague"" and is rarely enforced but is interpreted by authorities as ""penile penetration of anything other than a vagina"" according to Dr Anima Adjepong a US-based Ghanaian sociologist researching gender sexuality and identity in West Africa.Being gay in Ghana: LGBT community is 'under attack'How has the LGBT community reacted?The Ghana News Agency reported on Monday that police had arrested two people who had been living together for about two months for alleged homosexual activities.However the accused denied the allegations.Campaign group RetifyGhana tweeted that five gay people were also remanded in custody last week denouncing the latest bill as a ""homophobes dream"".""In Ghana homophobia is being promoted by religious political and media personalities. The media especially participates and enables homophobia"" the rights group added in atweet.There are 69 countries that have laws that criminalise homosexuality and nearly half of these are in Africa.However in some countries there have been moves to decriminalise same-sex unions.In February this year Angola's President JoÃ£o LourenÃ§o signed into law a revised penal code to allow same-sex relationships and bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.Related TopicsGhanaLGBTMore on this storyLGBT in Ghana: âWe deserve to be protectedâPublished11 March";Anglican church head condemns Ghana anti-gay bill;https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-59062483;mindset;0.930000
"Poland told to pay â¬1m a day in legal row with EUPublished1 hour agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage sourceEPAImage captionOne opinion poll suggests most Poles think the government should either concede or compromiseThe EU's top court has told Poland to pay a daily fine of â¬1m (Â£850000) in an row over judicial reforms.Earlier this year Poland was ordered to suspend a controversial disciplinary chamber but has not yet done so.Poland has repeatedly been at loggerheads with the EU over changes that are seen as weakening the independence of Polish courts.This month Poland's Constitutional Tribunal angered European leaders by in effect rejecting the primacy of EU law.The ruling said parts of EU law were incompatible with the Polish constitution prompting European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to speak of a ""direct challenge to the unity of the European legal order"".The original case was taken to the tribunal by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki in a bid to prevent Polish judges using EU law to challenge his government's judicial changes.One significant factor in the EU-Poland row is that the European Commission is yet to approve â¬57bn (Â£48bn; $66bn) of Covid-19 recovery funds earmarked for Poland and may not do so until its judiciary dispute is settled.An opinion poll on Tuesday suggested that 40.8% of Poles believed their government should concede defeat and end the row while another 32.5% said it should compromise.A central plank of Poland's controversial reforms is a disciplinary chamber of the Supreme Court that critics argue is being used to punish independent judges because it has the power to sanction the content of their rulings.Back in July the European Court of Justice (ECJ) delivered an interim ruling that Poland should suspend the chamber as it was neither sufficiently independent nor impartial. The Polish prime minister has said the chamber will be shut down in its current form but he has insisted that EU institutions have no right to tell Warsaw how to organise its judiciary.BBC Warsaw correspondent Adam Easton says the Supreme Court has stopped scheduling new cases for the chamber but it has continued hearing cases that are already scheduled.Poland stokes fears of leaving EU in 'Polexit'Last month the EU asked the Luxembourg-based court to impose a daily fine until Poland responded. On Wednesday the court's vice-president ruled that the fine would have to be paid until Poland either suspended the chamber or until the final ruling on its future.The vice-president said the fine was being imposed to deter Polandfrom ""delaying bringing its conduct into line with that order"" and it was necessary to ""avoid serious and irreparable harm to the legal order of the European Union"".This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media captionEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says she is ""deeply concerned"" about Poland's court rulingPoland's leader told the European Parliament this month it was ""unacceptable to talk about financial penalties"" and he accused the EU of overstepping its powers.His conservative-nationalist government has already been ordered by the ECJ to pay â¬500000 a day for failing to shut down temporarily the enormous Turow coal mine and power plant close to the German and Czech borders. Poland has refused to pay that fine because it argues the plant heats and provides water to local homes.Related TopicsEuropean Court of JusticeEuropean UnionPolandMore on this storyPolish PM accuses EU of blackmail in law rowPublished19 OctoberMass protests in Poland amid EU exit fearsPublished11 October";Poland told to pay €1m a day in legal row with EU;https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59064883;mindset;0.930000

Jury selection began on Monday and a trial is due to start as early as this week.Here's what we know.'A battle for the soul of America'Charlottesville attacker: I regret my actionsThe black man who took on the KlanWhat is the lawsuit about?The lawsuit alleges that the defendants ""conspired to plan promote and carry out the violent events"" that took place at the rally.""Defendants brought with them to Charlottesville the imagery of the Holocaust of slavery of Jim Crow and of fascism"" the lawsuit says. ""They also brought with them semi-automatic weapons pistols mace rods armour shields and torches.""Attorneys for the plaintiffs say they have collected more than 5.3 terabytes of evidence including social media posts and chat room exchanges from messaging platform Discord.The lawsuit invokes a 1871 law passed after the US Civil War which was originally intended to protect black Americans from the Ku Klux Klan following their emancipation from slavery.The law allows private citizens to sue others believed to have committed civil rights violations. The plaintiffs however must prove that the defendants conspired to do so and that injuries resulted.""That's just a testament to the fact that we have a situation in this country where people can credibly accuse others of committing the kind of act that Congress was worried about after the Civil War"" attorney Roberta Kaplan was quoted as saying by the Washington Post.The lawsuit is backed by a campaign group Integrity First for America.""The goal first and foremost is accountability for the defendants and justice for the plaintiffs and for the community in Charlottesville"" said the group's Executive Director Amy Spitalnick.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media captionThe statue of General Robert E Lee was towed away from Market Street Park CharlottesvilleWhat is the defence team saying?The defendants include prominent figures in America's white nationalist and far-right movement including Jason Kessler the rally's main organiser and Richard Spencer a white supremacist who famously coined the term ""alt-right"" and spoke at the event.Some of the defendants including Mr Spencer and ""the crying Nazi"" Christopher Cantwell - so nicknamed for a tearful YouTube video he posted in the aftermath of the rally - are representing themselves in court.Several of the defendants have also claimed that mentions of violence combat and weapons ahead of the event were referencing the possibility of having to defend themselves from counter-protesters.Some have said that their communications are protected by their constitutional rights.""You can say any nasty thing you want about any person or group you want and that is protected by the First Amendment"" Edward ReBrook IV an attorney for one of the defendants former Nationalist Socialist Movement leader Jeff Schoep told the Associated Press. ""That's not me saying that that's the Supreme Court.""Several of the defendants and their lawyers did not respond to the BBC's requests for comment.The plaintiffs have already received default judgements against seven of the defendants who refused to cooperate.What happened at the murder trial?The man who drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters at the Charlottesville rally James Alex Fields was sentenced to life in prison in June 2019.Four of the plaintiffs in the current lawsuit were injured in the incident which killed Heather Heyer 32.Image sourceGetty ImagesImage captionA street memorial in Charlottesville commemorated the death of Heather Heyer in the days after the rallyA self-described neo-Nazi from Ohio Fields pleaded guilty to 29 of 30 federal hate crimes as part of a deal with prosecutors who agreed to not seek the death penalty.At his sentencing in 2019 Fields apologised for the ""hurt and loss"" he caused at the Unite the Right event.""Every day I think about how things could have gone differently and how I regret my actions"" he said. ""I'm sorry.""In December 2018 Fields was also convicted of murder at the state level.How might this court case affect future rallies and protests?Advocates for the plaintiffs have explicitly said that they hope to bankrupt the Unite the Right organisers and send a message to other far-right extremists and white supremacists in the future.""A case like this can also have much broader impacts in making clear there will be very real consequences for violent extremism deterring others who are looking on and understanding those consequences"" said Integrity First's Ms Spitalnick.Mark Pitcavage a senior research fellow at the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism who has monitored far-right groups for decades told the BBC that the case ""has the potential to deal a blow to the white supremacist movement"".Mr Pitcavage said that many rally organisers and attendees already suffered consequences in the immediate aftermath of the rally.These consequences ranged from job losses and school expulsions after being publicly ""outed"" as white supremacists to legal consequences such as the current lawsuit and Mr Field's murder conviction.""The trial itself serves white supremacists as a reminder of what a debacle Charlottesville turned out to be"" Mr Pitcavage added. ""It's almost like a booster shot to the backlash in 2017 reminding everyone how badly that turned out for white supremacists.""How was Charlottesville a defining moment in US politics?Opponents of former US President Donald Trump often refer to the incident as one of the defining moments of his administration.At the time Mr Trump came under fire from both sides of the political spectrum for comments at a news conference. He said ""you had some very bad people in that group but you also had people that were very fine people on both sides"".

"Hong Kong passes new film censorship lawPublished4 hours agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage sourceGetty ImagesImage captionCritics say the new law will affect Hong Kong's vibrant film industryHong Kong's legislature has passed a new law banning films deemed to violate China's national security interests the latest blow to freedom of expression in the territory.Punishment for violating the law includes up to three years imprisonment and $130000 (Â£95000) in fines.Critics say the legislation will stifle the vibrant local film industry.Last year China imposed a national security law on Hong Kong that effectively outlawed dissent.The legislation which came after huge pro-democracy protests in 2019 criminalises secession subversion terrorism and collusion with foreign forces. Critics say it is aimed at crushing dissent but China says it is meant to maintain stability.The film censorship law was approved in the opposition-free Legislative Council. It gives the chief secretary - the second-most powerful figure in the city's administration - the power to revoke a film's licence if it is found to ""endorse support glorify encourage and incite activities that might endanger national security"".ANALYSIS:China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried?EXPLAINER:Hong Kong's year under controversial lawExperts and content producers have raised worries about the impact of the legislation which does not cover films posted online on creativity and freedom of expression.Filmmaker Kiwi Chow whose documentary Revolution of Our Times about the 2019 protests was featured at the Cannes Film Festival this year told Reuters news agency the law would ""worsen self-censorship and fuel fear among filmmakers"".A speedy jobBy Martin Yip BBC News Chinese Hong KongThe bill was passed by a simple showing of hands at the last meeting of the council's much extended current term. And despite the lack of opposition in the legislature lawmakers still debate.Councillor Luk Chung-hung claimed it was political films that hindered creativity not the proposed censorship law. Another councillor Priscilla Leung who is also a law professor insisted the bill was in full compliance with human rights laws and she hoped to stop such films from ""brainwashing"" young people.Filmmakers will certainly be concerned. Dr Kenny Ng of the Hong Kong Baptist University's Film Academy said the new law would see film distributors worrying if their already-approved films would be withdrawn meaning more uncertainty in the industry.As for the lawmakers it is time to prepare for winning their job back as the election takes place in December - under completely new election laws.The arts industry was already being targeted even before the new law. In June a local theatre pulled the award-winning documentary Inside The Red Brick Wall also about the 2019 protests and its distributor lost government funding.Book publishers have admitted to self-censoring and the largest pro-democracy paper Apple Daily closed earlier this year amid a national security investigation.Meanwhile many opposition figures are already in prison or in exile.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media captionThe Hong Kong director standing up to ChinaRelated TopicsChinaFilmHong Kong national security lawHong Kong";Hong Kong passes film censorship law;https://www.bbc.com;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-59047633;mindset;0.930000
