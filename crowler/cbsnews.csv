"Cairo— Sudan's interim Prime Minister Abdulla Hamdok and many of the country's other civilian leaders were detained on Monday as a military coup unfolded in the northeast African nation. The country's information ministry said Hamdok and the others were detained after he refused to take part in the coup by military commanders with whom he and other politicians had shared power for just over two years as part of atransition to democracyafter decades of authoritarian rule.A Sudanese protester draped with the national flag flashes the victory sign next to burning tires during a demonstration in the capital Khartoum October 25 2021 to denounce overnight detentions by the army of members of Sudan's government.AFP via GettyThe military head of the shared army-civilian transitional Sovereign Council which had governed Sudan since August 2019 under a power-sharing agreement took to the airwaves of the country's national broadcaster later on Monday to confirm that the military had seized control.General Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman al-Burhan said in the televised remarks that the Sovereign Council had been dissolved along with the country's civilian cabinet and he declared a nationwide state of emergency.Chairman of the Sovereignty Council of Sudan Gen.

A Sudanese doctors association said at least 12 protesters were injured with gunshot wounds after crossing a barbed wire barrier on the road leading to the army's headquarters in Khartoum.Al-Burhan said a new government of technocrats would be put in place to take over the political transition until elections in 2023.

The call was heeded and civilians set up road blocks with burning tires in the capital city of Khartoum to protest the detention of the political leaders by the military.The full military takeover is a major setback for Sudan which has grappled with a transition to democracy since long-time autocratOmar al-Bashir was toppledby mass protests more than two years ago. Sudan has been run for several years by a civilian-military transitional government.The Reuters news agency cited sources as saying soldiers had arrested most cabinet members and many pro-government party leaders.U.S. Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa Jeffrey Feltman said Washington was ""deeply alarmed"" over the reports of the military takeover adding that it puts U.S. assistance ""at risk.""

"Hollywood starRichard Gerehas been summoned to testify as Italy's former interior minister and far-right leader Matteo Salvini went on trial Saturday for allegedly illegally blockingover 100 migrants in dire sanitary conditionsfrom disembarking from a rescue ship in 2019.On the opening day of the trial in Palermo Judge Roberto Murgia said all the witnesses submitted by the parties would be allowed to testify including Gere  who made a humanitarian visit to the ship  and Italy's former prime minister Giuseppe Conte.Salvini the leader of the far-right League party who is known for an ""Italians first"" policy is charged with kidnapping and abuse of office for using his position as interior minister to detain the 147 migrants at sea in August 2019.The hearing was largely procedural and lasted less than three hours before Murgia set the next hearing for December 17.Salvini who was present in court could face a maximum of 15 years in prison if convicted.""You tell me how serious a trial is where Richard Gere will come from Hollywood to testify about my nastiness"" Salvini told journalists outside the courtroom. ""I hope it lasts as short a time as possible because there are more important things to take care of.""In atweet referencing Gere Salvini said he was ""proud of having done my duty and defending the borders!""Salvini has said he was protecting Italy with his ""closed ports"" policy aimed at stopping people attempting the dangerous Mediterranean crossing.A man waves as he disembarks from the Open Arms rescue ship on the Sicilian island of Lampedusa southern Italy Tuesday Aug. 20 2019.Salvatore Cavalli / APHe has claimed the decision not to allow the ship to dock was not his alone but agreed by the government including by then-prime minister Conte.Other witnesses the court allowed to testify include Italy's current Interior Minister Luciana Lamorgese and Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio.Civil party Open Arms the Spanish charity that operated the rescue vessel had requested Gere as a witness since he had boarded the ship in solidarity with the migrants before it docked at the Sicilian island of Lampedusa.""Saving people isn't a crime but an obligation""Ahead of the hearing Salvini tweeted a photo of himself inside the courtroom standing in front one of the cells used for some defendants.""This is the courtroom of the Palermo prison.

Several jumped overboard and attempted to swim to shore.A subsequent onboard inspection revealed serious overcrowding and dire sanitary conditions.Italy's Senate voted last year to strip Salvini of his parliamentary immunity paving the way for the trial.A related case in which Salvini was accused of blocking other migrants at sea on an Italian coastguard boat was thrown out by a court in Catania earlier this year.Salvini's League takes a hard line on migrants arguing that Italy bears an unfair burden as the first point of entry into Europe for those arriving from northern Africa.When he blocked the ships Salvini was part of a coalition government and held the positions of interior minister and deputy prime minister.Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesPablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical adviceSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";Richard Gere summoned to testify at Italy's leader trial;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/richard-gere-testify-italy-matteo-salvini-trial-migrants-ship/;mindset;0.930000
"An elephant has trampled a suspected poacher to death in South Africa's famed Kruger National Park a spokesman said Friday. The mangled body was discovered Thursday during an intelligence operation aimed at preventing poaching Kruger spokesman Isaac Phaahla told AFP.But before any animals were harmed an elephant stomped one poacher to death while the others fled Phaahla said.""Initial investigations suspect that the deceased was killed by an elephant and left behind by his accomplices"" he added.The elephant spared the man's cell phone which rangers have turned over to police to aid their efforts to track down his fellow poachers he said.Earlier this year anothersuspected poacher was trampled and killedby a herd of elephants at the park.

"A San Jose California woman born in India was one of two foreign tourists killed in the apparent crossfire of a drug-gang shootout in Mexico's Caribbean coast resort of Tulum. Authorities in Quintana Roo the state where Tulum Playa del Carmen and Cancun are located said one of the dead women was Anjali Ryot.AnInstagram accountunder the same name showed a post of Ryot lounging and smiling on a seaside pier in Tulum two days ago. It listed her as a travel blogger from Himachal India living in California. A linked Facebook page said she lived in San Jose.A police vehicle is parked outside the restaurant the day after a fatal shooting in Tulum Mexico Friday Oct. 22 2021. Two foreigners were killed and three wounded in a shooting in the Mexican Caribbean resort town of Tulum.Christian Rojas / APA German woman who was killed has been identified as Jennifer Henzold though no hometown was immediately available for her.Three other foreign tourists were wounded in the shooting late Wednesday at a street-side eatery that has some outdoor tables right off Tulum's main strip. They included two German men and a Dutch woman.The German Foreign Office issued a travel advisory about the violence advising its citizens ""if you are currently in the Tulum or Playa del Carmen area do not leave your secured hotel facilities.""The gunfight apparently broke out between two groups that operate street-level drug sales in the area according to prosecutors. The tourists were apparently dining at the restaurant and may have been caught in the crossfire.The shooting occurred on Tulum's 'Mini-Quinta' a reference to Playa del Carmen's larger flashier bar and restaurant zone known as Quinta Avenida or Fifth Avenue.On Friday the civic group Citizens Observatorio of Tulum posted photos of hand-lettered signs that appeared at a local market in Tulum signed by a drug gang known as Los Pelones roughly ""the Shaved Heads.""The sign said the shooting ""was a warning so you can see we mean business"" adding ""you either get in line or we are going to continue shutting places down like the Mini Quinta"" an apparent warning to pay extortion demands for protection money.""We are in control here"" the sign added. The gang part of the Gulf Cartel has long extorted protection money from bars and night clubs in Cancun but has now apparently extended operations further south to Playa del Carmen and Tulum. The gang is also fighting the Jalisco Cartel and other groups for the area's lucrative drug market.The killings threatened Tulum's reputation as a low-key carefree beach town without the crowding and problems of Cancun.After the shooting U.S. tourist James Graham said he had come to Tulum with the idea of possibly buying a property there to rent out on AirBnB. ""Right now we are not so sure we're going to buy anything here"" Graham said.""I think that what was surprising is we figured that this type of crime wouldn't necessarily be where the main tourist areas are just because it's such a big part of the economy"" Graham said. ""You would think that you would be very careful to make sure that you know the tourists feel very safe coming here.""But there have been signs the situation was out of control months ago. In June two men were shot to death on the beach in Tulum and a third was wounded.And in nearby Playa del Carmen police stage a massive raid Thursday on the beach town's restaurant-lined Quinta Avenida detaining 26 suspects - most apparently for drug sales - after a city policewoman was shot to death and locked in the trunk of a car last week. Prosecutors said Friday they have arrested a suspect in that killing.Crime ""has gone up a little with extortion with drug sales to foreigners and Mexicans"" the prosecutor's office said in a statement about the raid.The administration of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has pinned its hopes on Tulum where it has announced plans to build an international airport and a stop for the Maya train which will run in a loop around the Yucatan peninsula.Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesPablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical adviceSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";U.S. travel blogger among 2 women killed in Mexico resort shooting;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/anjali-ryot-us-blogger-killed-tulum-mexico-shooting/;mindset;0.930000
"Hong Kong— President Joe Biden said on Thursday that the United States would defend Taiwan ifChinaever attacked the democratically governed island.

"London —Police forces across the U.K. are investigating reports of women being drugged with needles while out at bars or clubs according to the National Police Chiefs' Council. Several women in cities across England reported blacking out after feeling scratching sensations or then waking up the next day to find what they believe to be puncture wounds on their bodies.Student groups in more than 40 cities across the U.K. have organized boycotts of nightclubs next week with many young women saying they're afraid of being drugged and that not enough is being done to tackle the issue of ""spiking"" which is when someone gives someone else drugs or alcohol without their knowledge often by secretly adding it to their drink.""A pin prick in my leg""""I went out with my friends to a nightclub in the city nothing more than what we would usually do"" Sarah Buckle a student at the University of Nottingham told CBS News partner network BBC News. ""I remember going in going to the bar going to the toilet and the photo booth and then after that moment my memory is a blank until I get home.""Buckle said that when she woke up the next morning her leg hurt a lot.""I didn't find any bruising or anything but I found a pin prick in my leg which was the epicenter of all pain. It made me unable to walk and I was limping around.""Buckle  went to the hospital and tried to get tested for drugs but said she was told it was too late as any drugs that might have been used on her would already have left her system. She asked to be tested for HIV and other illnesses that could have been carried by a dirty needle and she was awaiting those results.""We are currently investigating reports of individuals suspecting that their drinks have been spiked. Linked to this a small number of victims have said that they may have felt a scratching sensation as if someone may have spiked them physically"" Nottinghamshire Police Superintendent Kathryn Craner told the BBC.""We do not believe that these are targeted incidents. They are distinctly different from anything we have seen previously as victims have disclosed a physical scratch type sensation before feeling very unwell. This is subtly different from feelings of intoxication through alcohol according to some victims"" she said.Drink spikingThe Nottinghamshire police are investigating at least a dozen reports of possible spiking with needles along with other reports of spiking and at least one man has been arrested in connection with those investigations.Dr. Adam Winstock who founded the Global Drugs Survey told CBS News that it's crucial to investigate these reports but the practicalities of injecting someone make it a far more difficult way of drugging someone than other methods.""Within hospital settings you know medication is drawn up in a syringe. The patient is complying. Their arm or their leg is still and you pop the needle in and you inject it slowly in a way where it's you know relatively painless"" he said. ""The idea that someone is walking around with a loaded syringe that they randomly are able to jab into someone in a way that doesn't cause someone to immediately pull back before that drug has actually been injected just that's really difficult.""Winstock said it was much more common for people to be spiked in other ways.""The most common drug used in suspected drink spiking is alcohol and that's because it's the easiest drug to add to other alcoholic beverages without people knowing"" he said. ""What's terrifying for most people is not knowing what's happening.""""An epidemic""The reports of spiking with needles triggered an outpouring of anonymous accounts of other forms of spiking on social media and women at universities across the country are planning boycotts of nightclubs and bars next week.An online petition calling for clubs to do more to search customers for possible date-rape drugs before they're allowed to enter got more than 160000 signatures which means it will be considered for debate by the British parliament.""Spiking has become an epidemic. Never before have we heard so many students waking up with no memory of what had happened the night before"" said one social media account behind a boycott being planned in Edinburgh Scotland. ""This is not getting 'black-out drunk' this is getting drugged and is something that can be changed.""The boycott organizers are asking for bars and clubs to increase their security provide drink protection services and a safe way for customers to get medical attention or back home in the case of a suspected attack.""This is NOT a stay at home message. This is asking our students to protest against the clubs and bars"" they said.

"An ancient solar storm and some wooden remains from old Nordic village prove that Christopher Columbus was not the first non-Indigenous person in North America scientists say. New findings show that Vikings landed on the continent 1000 years ago and hundreds of years before Columbus.Researchers who published their findings in the journalNature were able to determine the date Vikings were present by analyzing three pieces of wood from three different trees that had been chopped by Vikings at L'Anse aux Meadows a national historic site in Newfoundland Canada. The site has long been revered for being the first known evidence of European presence in the Americas according to Parks Canada but the exact date Vikings were present was not known.Pictures of the wood items from L'Anse aux Meadows that were studied.M. KuitemsResearchers used radiocarbon dating — a way to estimate age based on the amount of carbon-14 in a living thing — on the wood to determine the Vikings' arrival. The method allows for a rough estimate but what really narrowed it down for researchers was a massive solar storm that occurred in 992 AD. The huge bursts of energy emitted from the sun put additional carbon in the atmosphere thus spiking the amount of carbon in living things for that period of time.The wooden pieces the Vikings had chopped have still-visible tree rings. One of the rings matched up with the solar storm and had 29 growth rings that formed thereafter meaning that the wood was chopped 29 years after the solar storm occurred in 992 A.D. — in 1021.All of the wooden pieces had been clearly chopped with metal tools which was evident by their ""characteristically clean low angle-in cuts"" researchers said. Tools such as this were not present in Indigenous communities in the area at that time.In their paper researchers said that 1021 A.D. now marks the ""earliest known year by which human migration had encircled the planet"" proving that Vikings arrived in North America 471 years before Christopher Columbus who ventured to the Bahamas in 1492.L'Anse aux Meadows is aUNESCO World Heritage Site that the organization says has ""exceptional archaeological"" items including eight timber-framed turf structures. Those structures UNESCO says are built in the same style as ones found in Norse Greenland and Iceland from the same period. Other artifacts found at the site indicate the Vikings produced iron and woodworking products.At least five or six Indigenous tribes are believed to have been in the area as far back as6000 years ago according to Parks Canada. In2019 researchers published their findings of numerous stone tools and other items from Indigenous groups at L'Anse aux Meadows prompting them to believe that there may have been more interactions between the Vikings and Indigenous groups than what has been previously thought.Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesPablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical adviceSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsLi CohenLi Cohen is a social media producer and trending reporter for CBS News focusing on social justice issues.";Vikings landed in North America 471 years before Columbus;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vikings-north-america-470-years-before-christopher-columbus/;mindset;0.930000

"Members of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions wear costumes from the Netflix series ""Squid Game"" for a march to Seoul City Hall during a rally against the government's labor policies October 20 2021 in Seoul South Korea.Chris Jung/NurPhoto/GettySeoul— Frustrated South Korean workers have sought to seize an opportunity presented by the huge popularity of Netflix's ""Squid Game"" to draw attention to their demands for better employment conditions. Thousands of people staged demonstrations in Seoul and elsewhere on Thursday many incostumesinspired by the gruesome show that was itselfinspired by the dire economic conditionsfacing many South Koreans.""Squid Game"" one of Netflix'smost popular shows ever is about hundreds of cash-strapped South Koreans lured into competing in series of simple games for a massive cash prize but the penalty for losing any of the six stages is an instant and brutal death. It was inspired by the conditions for normal South Koreans following the global economic collapse in 2008.The main character is the series Seong Gi-Hun is autoworker who lost his job when the company he spent years working for went bust. His flashbacks draw stark parallels to the real-life 2009 bankruptcy of the Ssangyong automaker and the subsequent violent crackdown on laid-off employees who occupied its factory demanding their jobs back.Foreign viewers may be surprised by the extent to which the dramatic narrative has resonated so strongly with South Koreans who face daily challenges in a highly competitive society that many believe values hard work and personal sacrifice over well-being.An image posted online by the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) as part of ""Squid Game""-themed promotional material touting huge demonstrations staged across South Korea on October 20 2021 demanding changes to government labor policies.KCTU/InstagramThe Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) made that and ""Squid Game"" their central theme in organizing the rallies on Wednesday. The group even produced a ""Squid Game""-stylepromotional video for social mediafeaturing South Korean workers or actors portraying them touting support for the various labor unions and calling for government help.Despite a COVID-19 restriction banning gatherings of more than 99 people the police estimated that about 16000 people joined the demonstrations across the country on Wednesday the largest one being in the capital.View this post on InstagramA post shared by 민주노총 (@kctu_official)KCTU called the general protest action ""the first step towards overcoming inequality in the world.""""We continue to move forward to a world of equality with the cries of workers who filled the streets and resounded across the country"" the group said demanding an end to irregular employment contracts and laws they say fail to protect employees in small companies with fewer than five employees from discrimination.The KCTU also called for the right for all workers to form unions; for the government to take more responsibility for ensuring job security as the country's economy transitions from industry to services; and for the strengthening of public transportation networks medical care housing and education.While South Korea has had relatively low numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths its economy was hit hard by the pandemic. While citizens struggle through the hard times they've been hit with regular stories on the news about the rich and powerful engaging in multi-million-dollar corruption and embezzlement cases. A presidential candidate is among the latest power-players to be caught up in such a case.And South Koreans have seen it all play out as major business conglomerates slash new recruitment pushing many people to take on second and third jobs to cope with the instability of low-hour limited contract or no-contract work.A member of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions in a ""Squid Game"" costume marches to Seoul City Hall during a rally against the government's labor policies October 20 2021 in Seoul South Korea.Chris Jung/NurPhoto/GettyOpponents of the union protests have been quick to point out that large gatherings like Wednesday's violate the country's coronavirus control measures and risk increasing infections which could further harm the ailing economy.President Moon Jae-in's office at the Blue House for instance called the protests ""disappointing.""""Considering that we've come to a relatively stabilized COVID situation while the whole nation is preparing for daily recovery with one mind and heart we hoped the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions would refrain from going on strike on a grand scale but it turned out to be a disappointing result"" a Blue House spokesperson said on Thursday.Little sympathy from those in charge for the losers in this game.Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical advicePablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";"South Korean workers channel ""Squid Game"" to protest economic woes";https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/south-korea-squid-game-labor-union-protest/;mindset;0.930000

"Hong Kong— South Korea had a partial success on Thursday in its attempt to join the global space race. The country successfully launched its first home-grown rocket but while on its way into orbit things didn't go as planned.Lift-off of the ""Nuri"" rocket — which means ""world"" — looked smooth but as the minutes dragged into more than an hour there was no confirmation from South Korean officials of the total success they'd been hoping for.After about 90 minutes President Moon Jae-in appeared on television praising everyone who worked on the mission but revealing that the payload a dummy satellite had failed to make it into orbit.An image provided by the Korea Aerospace Research Institute in South Korea shows the first test launch of the country's home-grown Nuri rocket on October 21 2021.Korea Aerospace Research Institute""Separation of the dummy satellite was accomplished without any problems. It was done completely with our own technology"" Moon told his nation. ""However placing the dummy satellite in orbit remains an unfinished task.""He lauded the team behind the project and said South Korea was ""getting closer to space.""The Nuri launched at 5 p.m. local time after a one-hour delay due to strong winds. It has been about 10 years in the making at an estimated cost of around $1.6 billion. The Nuri is built to travel almost 500 miles above our planet's surface and is designed to shuttle payloads of up to 1.5 tons into orbit.It might have reached that goal if the third-and-final-stage engine had fired for as long as planned during the launch. South Korea's Ministry of Science and ICT which carried out the launch said an analysis showed the stage-three engine fired for about 45 seconds short of the planned 8.7 minutes which meant the rocket failed to generate enough speed to push the dummy satellite into orbit.South Korea has said it eventually plans to launch real satellites into orbit on Nuri rockets for surveillance and communication purposes.North Koreawas no doubt watching the launch. The Kim regime has already sent its first satellite into orbit in 2012. And Thursday's partial success for South Korea came on the heels ofNorth Korea's latest weapons test: Pyongyang test fired a ballistic missile designed to be launched from a submarine just two days ago.It was the eighth significant weapons test by the North this year including missiles launched from trains and a claim by Pyongyang to havetested a hypersonic missilein September. That kind of technology can send missiles flying at least five times the speed of sound making them much harder to track and destroy.North Korea fires suspected sub-launched ball...01:59All of these launches have kept the Korean Peninsula and the entire region on edge.While South Korea failed to completely hit the mark it was aiming for on Thursday the country has already planned four more attempts to get it right with launches scheduled through 2027.President Moon has already vowed that his country will ""realize the dream"" of reaching the moon with a lunar probe by 2030.North KoreaMoreNorth Korea confirms test of missile designed for submarine launchN.

"La Palma Island Spain —An unprecedented drone operation was being prepared Wednesday to rescue four dogs stranded for weeks between rivers of red-hot lava streaming from anerupting volcanoon the Spanish island of La Palma.The emaciated dogs are stranded in two empty water tanks in the town of Todoque flanked by slow moving lava flows from the Cumbre Vieja volcano that erupted on September 19.The molten rock has so far covered over 1885 acres of land and destroyed around 2000 buildings although prompt evacuations have helped avoid fatalities in the island part of the Canary Islands off northwest Africa.Dogs are seen on ash-covered ground surrounded by volcanic lava following an eruption of the Cumbre Vieja volcano in the area of Todoque on the Canary Island of La Palma Spain in this undated screen grab taken from a handout video.LA PALMA LOCAL GOVERMENT/VOLCAOn its way to the Atlantic Ocean the lava has spared a few areas by creating ""islands"" of land that remain relatively unharmed such as the spot where the dogs are.Local animal association Leales.org sounded the alarm after it became aware of the plight of the dogs in early October and arranged for two drone firms to drop of food and water for the animals which have lost weight since becoming trapped.It also approached Spanish industrial drone operator Aerocameras to see if it could use one of its larger machines normally used to transport cargo to pluck the dogs to safety.A dog looks up from a patch of ash-covered ground surrounded by volcanic lava following an eruption of the Cumbre Vieja volcano in the area of Todoque on the Canary Island of La Palma Spain in this undated screen grab taken from a handout video.LA PALMA LOCAL GOVERMENT/VOLCAReaching the animals on foot is impossible as this would require walking on scorching lava and helicopters cannot fly in the area because the ash and hot gas from the volcano could damage their rotors said Leales.org spokesman Alejandro Molina.""This is the only way to do it"" he told AFP.An Aerocameras crew arrived on the island on Monday after receiving the green light from local authorities to carry out the rescue operation. Under Spanish law drones are normally not allowed to transport people or animals.The company's CEO Jaime Pereira said the plan was to send a 110 pounds drone equipped with a wide net to trap the dogs one by one and then fly them to safety.""We don't have experience transporting a live animal by drone nor does anyone"" he told private television Telecinco.A dog lies on ash-covered ground surrounded by volcanic lava following an eruption of the Cumbre Vieja volcano in the area of Todoque on the Canary Island of La Palma Spain in this undated screen grab taken from a handout video.LA PALMA LOCAL GOVERMENT/VOLCAThe success of the mission will depend largely on how the dogs respond to the drone he added.""The dog could react by running away moving jumping"" Pereira said.""There are those who say that the dog could fracture a bone have a heart attack.

"Moscow— Russian President Vladimir Putin told his country's employers on Wednesday that they would have to shut down again for a week  from the end of October — the most dramatic step by his government in months aimed at stemming the country's surgingcoronavirusepidemic. During a meeting with senior officials Putin backed a proposal to mandate ""non-working"" days from October 30 until November 7.Workers will be paid during the shutdown Putin said as he ordered an expansion of COVID-19 testing to try and more efficiently identify virus cases.""Our main task now is to protect the lives of citizens and as far as possible minimize the spread of coronavirus infection"" Putin said.He announced the new measure shortly after Russia announced yet another record number of dailycoronavirus deaths and a day after the Kremlin accepted for the first time a ""share of responsibility"" for the country's lackluster vaccination campaign.Only about 32% of Russia's total population is fully vaccinated against COVID-19 according to official data despite the shots being widely available since the beginning of the year. About 57% of Americans are fully vaccinated by comparison.Russia sees spike in COVID cases03:07The halting uptake of vaccines in Russia has kept hospitalization and death rates high. Russia reported 34073 new COVID-19 infections on Wednesday and set a grim new record with 1028 fatalities. The United Kingdom in contrast where about 66% of the population is fully vaccinated is still seeing very high daily case numbers — over 40000 each day for about a week — but the daily death toll from the virus has hovered for weeks around 150.""There is a tradition to blame the government for everything"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a Tuesday conference call.  ""Of course the government always feels and acknowledges its share of responsibility.""Peskov accepted that ""not everything that needed to be done was done in terms of the information campaign of the lack of alternatives to and the importance of vaccination"" but he added that ""a more responsible approach is required from all citizens of the country.""Russia reports surge in COVID deaths02:52Mistrust of the vaccines has been widespread in Russia fueled in part by officials appearing on state television early in the pandemic and downplaying the seriousness of COVID-19.The majority of Russia's regions have seen case numbers rise fast since September prompting authorities to revert to stricter control measures.During a government meeting on Tuesday Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova appealed to Putin to make the week starting October 30 a ""non-working"" week to keep people at home in a bid to slow the spread of the virus. In confirming his decision to enact the plan on Wednesday Putin ordered officials in regions with particularly high case rates to assess the situation bring in the business closures even sooner from October 23.The capital accounts for 21% of Russia's more than 8 million officially reported cases. Moscow's mayor has announced plans to reintroduce remote working along with avaccination mandatefor workers in service industries and other measures from next week. All employers will be obliged to have at least 30% of their staff work from home for the next four months until February 25 2022 Mayor Sergey Sobyanin wrote on his website.Employees who have been vaccinated or recovered recently from a COVID infection along with medical and other critical workers will be exempt from the requirements.According to Sobyanin the number of new cases being registered in the Moscow region since the summer has increased four-fold and the number of hospitalizations tripled.""I'm well aware of how tedious and uncomfortable the current restrictions are but there's simply no other way to protect you from serious illness"" he wrote adding a targeted appeal to older Muscovites whom he said had been reluctant to get the shots.A health worker transports a COVID-19 patient at the Kommunarka Hospital in Moscow Russia October 18 2021.Sefa Karacan/Anadolu Agency/Getty""Please get vaccinated.

"North Korea announced Wednesday that it had tested a newly developed missile designed to be launched from a submarine the first such weapons test in two years and one it says will bolster its military's underwater operational capability.The test Tuesday was the fifth round of missile launches since September and came as North Korea steps up pressure on Washington and Seoul to abandon what Pyongyang sees as hostile polices such as joint U.S.-South Korea military drills and international sanctions on the North.North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency said the latest test ""will greatly contribute to putting the defense technology of the country on a high level and to enhancing the underwater operational capability of our navy."" It said the new missile has introduced advanced control guidance technologies including flank mobility and gliding skip mobility.The North's neighbors said Tuesday that theydetected the North's missile firingand said the weapon landed in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. South Korea's military described the missile as a short-range submarine-launched ballistic missile and said the launch was made from waters near the eastern port of Sinpo where North Korea has a major shipyard building submarines.KCNA said Tuesday's launch was made from ""the same 8.24 Yongung ship"" a submarine that North Korea said it used to conduct its first submarine-launched strategic ballistic missile test in 2016. Photos published by North Korea show a missile rising and spewing bright flames above a cloud of smoke from the sea. One image shows the upper parts of what looks like a submarine on the surface of the sea.Tuesday's launch is the most high-profile weapons test by North Korea sinceU.S. President Joe Bidentook office in January. The Biden administration has repeatedly said it's open to resuming nuclear diplomacy with North Korea ""anywhere and at any time"" without preconditions. The North has so far rebuffed such overtures saying U.S. hostility remains unchanged.The launch came days before Sung Kim Biden's special envoy on North Korea was to travel to Seoul to discuss with allies the possibility of reviving diplomacy with Pyongyang.At a meeting in Washington with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts Kim emphasized U.S. condemnation of the launch which violates multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions and urged Pyongyang to refrain from further provocations and ""engage in sustained and substantive dialogue"" the State Department said.The U.N. Security Council scheduled emergency closed consultations on North Korea on Wednesday afternoon at the request of the United States and United Kingdom.Kim Dong-yub a professor at Seoul's University of North Korean Studies said the North Korean weapon tested Tuesday was likely derived from its land-based nuclear-capable KN-23 missile whose highly maneuverable and lower-trajectory flight provides it with greater chances of evading missile defense systems.He said the new missile was likely a small-sized weapon displayed during a defense exhibition last week. The professor said North Korea likely plans to load this missile on a new submarine it disclosed in 2019 while placing bigger SLBMs on larger submarines it is pushing to build in the future.Japanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi had said Tuesday that the North Korean missile flew on ""an irregular trajectory"" while traveling as far as 600 kilometers (360 miles).Nuclear negotiations between the U.S. and North Korea have been stalled for more than two years because of disagreements over an easing of crippling U.S.-led sanctions against North Korea in exchange for denuclearization steps by the North.Some experts say North Korea might continue its weapons tests for a couple of more months until it halts them in consideration of the Winter Olympics slated for February in China its last major ally and economic pipeline. They say the North may even test-launch long-range missiles directly threatening the U.S. mainland in a breach of a 2018 self-imposed moratorium on such weapons tests to maximize its pressure campaign.North Korea has been pushing hard for years to acquire the ability to fire nuclear-armed missiles from submarines the next key piece in an arsenal that includes a variety of weapons including ones with the potential range to reach American soil.Acquiring submarine-launched missiles would be a worrying development because that would make it harder for the North's rivals to detect launches and provide the country with retaliatory attack capability. Still experts say it would take years large amounts of resources and major technological improvements for the heavily sanctioned nation to build at least several submarines that could travel quietly in seas and reliably execute strikes.North Korea last tested a submarine-launched ballistic missile in October 2019.In a report this month on North Korea's military capabilities the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency said the North's pursuit of submarine-launched ballistic missile capabilities along with its steady development of land-based mobile long-range weapons highlight Pyongyang's intentions to ""build a survivable reliable nuclear delivery capability.""It said ""It is possible we could see a test of a long range missile (by North Korea) over the next year.""North KoreaMoreSouth Korea has partial success with 1st launch into the space raceN.

"Great white shark attacks are rare and when they do occur they are sometimes fatal. But attacks against the human species are often a result of mistaken identity new research published on Tuesday shows.Thestudy published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface was conducted by looking at humans and animals from a great white shark's eye view below the ocean surface. It's often been assumed that it's hard for sharks to differentiate between them but there is little research taking into account how sharks see rather than just from their perspective from underwater.Sharks according to the research have limited color perception if they are not completely color blind and have spatial resolving power that is ""considerably worse than humans."" So when they are looking for prey researchers found they more heavily rely on motion and brightness contrast.To determine how great white sharks primarily juveniles since they are most often the ones involved in human interactions might see objects when looking up from below the ocean surface researchers specifically compared video footage of rectangular floats humans swimming humans paddling surfboards and pinnipeds including sea lions and seals. The footage was filtered to mimic the sharks' visual system.And as it turns out the researchers found that juvenile great whites cannot significantly differentiate between the different life forms. The silhouettes of the different objects at the surface are too similar for the animals given their reliance on motion and light.""From the perspective of a white shark...neither visual motion nor shape cues allow an unequivocal visual distinction between pinnipeds and humans"" the study says ""supporting the mistaken identity theory behind some bites.""Laura Ryan the lead author of the study said in apress releasefrom Macquarie University that surfers are the most at-risk for fatal shark bites particularly from juveniles.""We found that surfers swimmers and pinnipeds (seals and sea lions) on the surface of the ocean will look the same to a white shark looking up from below because these sharks can't see fine details or colours"" she said.Professor Nathan Hart senior author of the study said thatgreat whiteshave to learn what to eat and their diet changes as they grow and learn. This could explain why juvenile sharks tend to be more commonly involved in biting humans. Adult sharks researchers said tend to have better vision and can better differentiate.""They need to develop a search image for these prey items and combine that with other sensory information"" Hart said. ""It's a learning process that could be prone to mistakes.""The study was also conducted in a controlled pool setting rather than the ocean leading researchers to believe that the sharks' ability to differentiate between humans and prey is actually worse because of the lower visibility in oceans. They also believe that the mistaken identity theory could apply to other shark species associated with human fatalities such as tiger sharks or bull sharks.But researchers also urged people to remember that shark bites are rare.

"An Israeli amateur diver found a large 900-year-old sword dating back to the Crusades at the bottom of Mediterranean Sea last week Israeliresearchers saidon Monday.The diver identified as Shlomi Katzin from Atlit Israel discovered the weapon on Saturday among other artifacts on the Mediterranean seabed including ancient stone anchors other anchors made of metal and pottery fragments according to the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA). The sword has a blade over 39 inches long and a hilt measuring nearly 12 inches and it likely once belonged to a crusading knight.Katzin brought the sword ashore after fearing it could be further buried under the sea's shifting sands.

"Hong Kong—Chinais shooting down a report claiming it successfully tested an advanced weapon known as a hypersonic missile. Beijing described the launch as a ""routine"" test of a reusable space vehicle but Washington insiders say that if China really has successfully tested hypersonic missile technology the U.S. is simply not ready to contend with the threat that poses.Hypersonic rockets travel at least five times the speed of sound and they can fly much lower to the ground than conventional ballistic missiles. That makes them much harder to trace and thus much harder to stop.The last time the world saw China's arsenal of hypersonic missiles was in 2019 as the Communist Partyput its latest technology on displayin a huge military parade through central Beijing's Tiananmen Square.North Korea claims hypersonic missile testDF-17 Dongfeng medium-range ballistic missiles equipped with DF-ZF hypersonic glide vehicles are seen in a military parade to mark the 70th anniversary of the Chinese People's Republic in Beijing China October 1 2019.Zoya Rusinova/TASS/GettyThe report in The Financial Times over the weekend claimed that China launched a hypersonic missile over the summer which it said circled the globe before landing about 25 miles from its intended target.Retired U.S. Admiral James ""Sandy"" Winnefeld a former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff called the apparent Chinese test ""an important surprise"" for American ""because it demonstrates the capability to have a very long-reach hypersonic weapon that could cause a lot of damage without us being able to do anything about it.""On Monday Beijing responded to the newspaper report with Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian telling reporters it was ""not a missile"" but rather ""a space vehicle"" used in a ""routine test"" as China develops technology to lower the cost of future space travel.Taiwan rejects China's reunification plans01:48But China has continued to build-up its military capabilities.

The test marked possibly the most significantdemonstration of the North's military mightsincePresident Joe Bidentook office.The launch came hours after the U.S. reaffirmed its offer to resume diplomacy on North Korea's nuclear weapons program. It underscored how the North continues to expand its military capabilities amid a pause in diplomacy.The South's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that it had detected the North firing one short-range ballistic missile it presumed as a submarine-launched ballistic missile from waters near the eastern port of Sinpo and that the South Korean and U.S. militaries were closely analyzing the launch.The South Korean military said the launch was made at sea but it didn't elaborate whether it was fired from a vessel submerged underwater or another launch platform above the sea's surface.The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said North Korea's latest launch did not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel territory or that of its allies.""The United States condemns these actions and calls on the DPRK to refrain from any further destabilizing acts"" it said using an abbreviation of North Korea's formal name the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.But Japanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi said his country's initial analysis suggested that the North fired two ballistic missiles. Japan's coast guard issued a maritime safety advisory to ships but didn't immediately know where the alleged missiles landed.The shipyard in Sinpo is a major defense industry hub where North Korea focuses its submarine production. In recent years the North has also used Sinpo to develop ballistic weapons systems designed to be fired from submarines.North Korea hadlast tested an SLBMin October 2019 but that missile was launched from land and South Korean analysts said it flew much further than the rocket fired on Tuesday.U.S. condemns North Korea missile test01:23Analysts had expected the North to resume tests of such weapons after it rolled out at least two new SLBMs during military parades in 2020 and 2021. There have also been signs that the North is trying to build a larger submarine that would be capable of carrying and firing multiple missiles.Kim Dong-yub a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul told CBS News' Jen Kwon on Tuesday that the seemingly shorter flight path of the missile tested on Tuesday compared to the most recent previous test could indicate a failed launch or more likely in his opinion that it was one of the new missiles put on show in recent years.""Looking at the recent pattern of weapons test fired by North Korea it seems that the mock-up unveiled at the military parade in 2020 October and this January is now being tested"" Kim told CBS News. ""This appears to be in accordance with the five-year plan to strengthen national defense capabilities discussed at the [North Korean] 8th Party Congress.""Kim said the North Korean regime appeared to be ""trying to maximize the performance in the military field"" to compensate in the eyes of the country's impoverished masses for grim economic realities imparted by the coronavirus pandemic and the raft of international sanctions against Pyongyang.South Korean officials held a national security council meeting and expressed ""deep regret"" over the launch that came despiteefforts to revive diplomacy. A strong South Korean response could anger North Korea which has been accusing Seoul of hypocrisy for criticizing the North's weapons tests whileexpanding its own conventional military capabilities.North Korea tests long-range missile01:40Ending a monthslong lull in September North Korea has been ramping up its weapons tests while making conditional peace offers to Seoul reviving a pattern of pressuring South Korea to try to get what it wants from the United States.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is ""developing submarine-launched ballistic missiles because it wants a more survivable nuclear deterrent able to blackmail its neighbors and the United States"" said Leif-Eric Easley a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.Easley added that North Korea ""cannot politically afford appearing to fall behind in a regional arms race"" with its southern neighbor.""North Korea's SLBM is probably far from being operationally deployed with a nuclear warhead"" he added.North Korea has been pushing hard for years to acquire an ability to fire nuclear-armed missiles from submarines the next key piece in Kim Jong Un's nuclear arsenal that includes a broad range of road mobile missiles and ICBMs with potential range to reach the American homeland.North Korea leader Kim Jong Un at paramilitary parade held to mark the 73rd founding anniversary of the republic at Kim Il Sung Square in Pyongyang in undated image supplied by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency on September 9 2021. KCNA via REUTERKCNA via REUTERSStill experts say it would take years resources and major technological improvements for the heavily sanctioned nation to build a fleet of at least several submarines that could travel quietly in seas and reliably execute strikes.Within days Biden's special envoy for North Korea Sung Kim is scheduled to meet with U.S. allies in Seoul over the prospects of reviving talks with North Korea.Nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have stalled for more than two years over disagreements in exchanging the release of crippling U.S.-led sanctions against North Korea and the North's denuclearization steps.But while North Korea is apparently trying to use South Korea's desire for inter-Korean engagement to extract concessions from Washington analysts say Seoul has little wiggle room as the Biden administration is intent on keeping sanctions in place until the North makes concrete steps toward denuclearization.""The U.S. continues to reach out to Pyongyang to restart dialogue. Our intent remains the same. We harbor no hostile intent toward the DPRK and we are open to meeting without preconditions"" Sung Kim told reporters on Monday.Last week Kim Jong Un reviewed powerful missiles designed to launch nuclear strikes on the U.S. mainland during a military exhibition and vowed to build an ""invincible"" military to cope with what he called persistent U.S. hostility. Earlier Kim dismissed U.S. offers for resuming talks without preconditions as a ""cunning"" attempt to conceal its hostile policy on the North.The country has tested various weapons over the past month including a new cruise missile that could potentially carry nuclear warheads and a developmental hypersonic missile. The test of the hypersonic missile on Sept. 28 came shortly before North Korean Ambassador Kim Song called for the Biden administration to permanently end joint military exercises with South Korea and the deployment of strategic military assets to the region in his speech to the U.N.

"Port-au-Prince Haiti— The State Department confirmed on Sunday that 16 Americans were among 17 people kidnapped in Haiti. A gang that was responsible for kidnapping five priests and two nuns earlier this year is being blamed for the recent kidnapping as well police say.""The welfare and safety of U.S. citizens abroad is one of the highest priorities of the Department of State"" the State Department said in a statement. ""We have been in regular contact with senior Haitian authorities and will continue to work with them and interagency partners. We will provide additional information as we are able.""The ""400 Mawozo"" gang kidnapped the group — which also included some elderly people — in Ganthier a commune that lies east of the capital of Port-au-Prince Haitian police inspector Frantz Champagne told The Associated Press.The gang whose name roughly translates to 400 ""inexperienced men"" controls the Croix-des-Bouquets area that includes Ganthier where they carry out kidnappings and carjackings and extort business owners according to authorities.Haiti is once again struggling with a spike in gang-related kidnappings that had diminished after President Jovenel Moïse wasfatally shotat his private residence on July 7 and following a 7.2-magnitudeearthquakethat struck southwest Haiti in August and killed more than 2200 people.The missionaries were on their way home Saturday from building an orphanage according to a message from Ohio-based Christian Aid Ministries sent to various religious missions.""This is a special prayer alert"" the one-minute message said. ""Pray that the gang members would come to repentance.""The message says the mission's field director is working with the U.S. Embassy and that the field director's family and one other unidentified man stayed at the ministry's base while everyone else visited the orphanage.No other details were immediately available.A U.S. government spokesperson said they were aware of the reports on the kidnapping.""The welfare and safety of U.S. citizens abroad is one of the highest priorities of the Department of State"" the spokesperson said declining further comment.Gangs have demanded ransoms ranging from a couple hundred dollars to more than $1 million according to authorities.Last month a deacon was killed in front of a church in the capital of Port-au-Prince and his wife kidnapped one of dozens of people who have been abducted in recent months.At least 328 kidnapping victims were reported to Haiti's National Police in the first eight months of 2021 compared with a total of 234 for all of 2020 according to a report issued last month by the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti known as BINUH.Gangs have been accused of kidnapping schoolchildren doctors police officers busloads of passengers and others as they grow more powerful. In April one gang kidnapped five priests and two nuns a move that prompted a three-day protest with Haitian now preparing for another protest scheduled for Monday to decry the lack of security in the impoverished country.""Political turmoil the surge in gang violence deteriorating socioeconomic conditions — including food insecurity and malnutrition — all contribute to the worsening of the humanitarian situation"" BINUH said in its report. ""An overstretched and under-resourced police force alone cannot address the security ills of Haiti.""On Friday the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously to extend the U.N. political mission in Haiti.The kidnapping of the missionaries comes just days after high-level U.S. officials visited Haiti and promised more resources for Haiti's National Police including another $15 million to help reduce gang violence which this year has displaced thousands of Haitians who now live in temporary shelters in increasingly unhygienic conditions.Among those who met with Haiti's police chief was Uzra Zeya U.S. under secretary of state for civilian security democracy and human rights.""Dismantling violent gangs is vital to Haitian stability and citizen security"" she recentlytweeted.Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical advicePablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";17 missionaries kidnapped by gang in Haiti police say;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/haiti-400-mawozo-kidnap-american-missionaries/;mindset;0.930000
"Wearing a mock Arab headdress Chris Greenslade between swigs from a bottle of Newcastle Brown Ale was proudly embracing his club's new status as one of the richest in world sports.""We're Saudis"" the 41-year-old Newcastle fan said. ""We can afford anything.""The gloating and celebrations from fans were only before Sunday's match against Tottenham at St. James' Park as the new era under Saudi ownership was heralded before reality set in.Callum Wilson put Newcastle ahead after just 107 seconds before the hosts collapsed to lose 3-2 and remain in the relegation zone. Much spending will be needed on players along with a new manager as the crowd was demanding.To receive the investment Newcastle fans have to — reluctantly in many cases — accept their long-underachieving club becoming embroiled in a sporting moral maze of the ethics of ownership by a state. Embracing the riches of the Saudi sovereign wealth fund to remove a long-despised owner means an unwelcome attachment with the murkier side of a kingdom.""You're going to get stuff like that along there"" Greenslade says pointing out a vehicle emblazoned with the name ""Jamal Khashoggi"" alongside an image of the journalist who was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018. There was also a photo of the Saudi crown prince implicated in the gruesome plot:Mohammed bin Salman.A van drives outside the stadum with picture of murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in protest to the takeover of Newcastle United Action Images.Reuters/Lee Smith""Is there any evidence?"" Greenslade said. ""Is it nailed on?""U.S. intelligence services said they believe the killing of the U.S.-based Saudi journalist came at the orders of the crown prince who heads the Public Investment Fund now owning 80% of Newcastle. Planes owned by a PIF company are said to have been used by the Saudi assassination squad. Prince Mohammed denies any wrongdoing.As the van circled St. James' Park Adel Al-Shammari a Saudi studying at university in Newcastle was watching in bemusement.""It's fake news"" he said. ""Believe me.""When the fate of Khashoggi his body and the findings of investigators was raised Al-Shammari was uneasy.""I know the story. It's not like you think"" he said. ""It's a different story. It's hard to explain.""Newcastle United chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan with part owner Amanda Staveley in the stands before the match.Reuters/Scott HeppellThis corner of northeast England is the latest extension of the Saudi state's efforts to enhance its image through sports investments.""Just visit Saudi Arabia ask the people there"" Al-Shammari said. ""You will find the truth.""For now it is regular Saudis in England doing the talking albeit not the new non-executive chairman of the club Yasir Al-Rumayyan who uses the title His Excellency and sits as governor on the PIF board dominated by Saudi ministers.Abdulrahman Alshmasi traveled to Newcastle from the central English city of Birmingham where he is studying to watch the club he started supporting when the protracted buyout was completed less than two weeks ago.""It's the richest club in the world now"" he said. ""Hopefully they'll become one of the best European teams.""That is the hope of local fans after 14 years of limited investment under the ownership of retail tycoon Mike Ashley desperate not just for a first trophy since the 1955 FA Cup but just to be competitive on the field.Matty Ward gave up his season ticket after being fed up with the lack of cash spent on the team and returned on Sunday after three years.""It's just brilliant I'm really happy"" the 18-year-old Ward said wearing an imitation of the red-and-white checkered headdress mimicking Saudis. ""To have a bit of hope in your club that's what football is about … to be able to believe in your club again.""Fans like Ward may try not to get too deep into the Saudi controversies highlighted by activists like Amnesty International who tried to block the deal.""Human rights is obviously a concern. If anything is proven then I expect it to be dealt with properly and thoroughly"" Ward said. ""But as long as there is clear separation between that and the club I don't see the problem.""To approve the sale that stalled last year the Premier League said it received ""legally binding assurances that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will not control Newcastle United Football Club."" The corporate ownership structure of PIF counters that although the Premier League won't discuss that or why the guarantees are required.Amanda Staveley who brokered the deal and now owns 10% through an investment vehicle has defended the new ownership and was at Sunday's game with Al-Rumayyan who was introduced to the crowd to cheers.One complicating factor for allowing the buyout was the Premier League pursuing legal means to shut down a television piracy operation linked to Saudi Arabia that was bootlegging footage from Qatari-owned beIN Sports. The thawing of the wider Gulf diplomatic dispute this year led to beIN being informed it was no longer banned in Saudi Arabia removing an obstacle for the change of ownership.How long it will be until footage of Newcastle celebrating a trophy will be beamed around the world remains unclear. The spending can't begin until the January transfer window to strengthen a team in next-to-last place with three points from eight games and a manager in Steve Bruce who fans chanted will be ""sacked in the morning.""Fans like Greenslade who had stopped coming to games a decade ago hold out hope that better times are now coming and the search is on for tickets that are hard to come by again. He says just coming to the stadium on a matchday is enough to start getting excited — ""after 14 years of absolute dross"" — about the prospect of exciting times ahead.He is prepared for a slow rebuilding as the squad is reconstructed.""It can take 10 years as long as it comes"" he said.

"Miami —Venezuela's government said Saturday it would halt negotiations with its opponents in retaliation for the extradition to the U.S. of a close ally of President Nicolás Maduro who prosecutors believe could be the most significant witness ever about corruption in the South American country.Jorge Rodríguez who has been heading the government's delegation said his team wouldn't travel to Mexico City for the next scheduled round of negotiations.The announcement capped a tumultuous day that saw businessman Alex Saab placed on a U.S.-bound plane in Cape Verde after a 16-month fight by Maduro and his allies including Russia who consider the Colombian-born businessman a Venezuelan diplomat.A few hours after news of Saab's extradition blew up Venezuelan social media six American oil executives held on house arrest were taken back to jail by security forces — a sign that relations between Washington and Caracas could be upended after months of quiet diplomacy since President Biden entered the White House. Families of the men known as the Citgo 6 — for the Houston subsidiary of Venezuela's state-owned oil company where they worked — expressed frustration with both governments.""The fact that Mr. Saab is in the U.S. before my father is a disgrace"" said Cristina Vadell whose father Tomeu Vadell is among the Americans serving out long sentences on what the U.S. government considers trumped-up charges.""This is additional proof that these Americans are held hostage in Venezuela and President Biden's administration needs to recognize this and win their release immediately"" she added.Saab is expected to make his initial appearance in court on Monday in Miami according to Justice Department spokesperson Nicole Navas Oxman who expressed gratitude and admiration to the government of Cabo Verde for its professionalism and ""perseverance with this complex case.""Saab 49 was arrested in the African archipelago while making a stop on the way to Iran for what Maduro's government later described as a diplomatic humanitarian mission that gives him immunity from prosecution.He quickly became a revolutionary rallying cry with Venezuela's government saying months after his arrest that the low-profile businessman had been appointed earlier a representative to the African Union — credentials whose authenticity and relevance U.S. prosecutors have questioned.Rodríguez standing in front of a sign reading ""Free Alex Saab"" blasted what he said was a ""brutal aggression"" on the part of a U.S. government that has been trying for years without success to oust Maduro. He said the Venezuelan government would denounce his illegal ""extraction"" in multilateral forums and in protest wouldn't partake in the next round of negotiations although he stopped short of saying the government would abandon the talks altogether.Venezuelan President of the National Assembly Jorge Rodriguez center speaks to the press in front of an image of Colombian businessman and Venezuelan special envoy Alex Saab in Caracas Venezuela Saturday October 16 2021.Ariana Cubillos / AP""The Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela deplores this serious violation against the human rights of a Venezuelan citizen who is invested as a diplomat and as a representative of our country to the world"" the Maduro government said in a statement. ""This fact sets a dangerous precedent for international law.""Government opponents including opposition leader Juan Guaidó who the U.S. recognizes as Venezuela's legitimate leader celebrated the prospect of soon seeing one of Maduro's top insiders behind bars — something of a moral victory after of string of heartbreaking defeats on the streets trying to break the socialist leader's grip on power.""What we Venezuelans feel today is justice"" said David Smolansky a Caracas-area mayor who fled into exile after his arrest was ordered for leading protests against Maduro in 2017. ""It's the same justice that has evaded us for 22 years. A justice that had to be found beyond our borders. A justice that should seek all those guilty of corruption crimes against humanity hunger and the migration crisis.""American authorities have been targeting Saab for years believing he can unlock the mystery of how Venezuela has been selling gold and tankers full of crude oil in violation of U.S. sanctions. They also believe he holds numerous secrets about how Maduro the president's family and his top aides siphoned off millions of dollars in government contracts for food and housing amid widespread hunger in oil-rich Venezuela.Federal prosecutors in Miamiindicted Saab in 2019on money-laundering charges connected to an alleged bribery scheme that pocketed more than $350 million from a low-income housing project for the Venezuelan government.Separately Saab had been sanctioned by the previous Trump administration for allegedly utilizing a network of shell companies spanning the globe — in the United Arab Emirates Turkey Hong Kong Panama Colombia and Mexico — to hide huge profits from no-bid overvalued food contracts obtained through bribes and kickbacks.Some of Saab's contracts were obtained by paying bribes to the adult children of Venezuelan first lady Cilia Flores the Trump administration alleged. Commonly known in Venezuela as ""Los Chamos"" slang for ""the kids"" the three men are also under investigation by prosecutors in Miami for allegedly forming part of a scheme to siphon $1.2 billion from Venezuela's state-owned oil company two people familiar with the U.S. investigation told The Associated Press.But while in private U.S. officials have long described Saab as a front man for Maduro he is not identified as such in court filings.The previous Trump administration had made Saab's extradition a top priority at one point even sending a Navy warship to the African archipelago to keep an eye on the captive.On Saturday Colombian President Iván Duque lauded the extradition of Saab calling it a ""triumph in the fight against drug trafficking money laundering and corruption led by the dictatorship of Nicolás Maduro.""However the Biden administration has downplayed the importance of Saab's problems saying he can defend himself in U.S. courts and that his case shouldn't affect the ongoing negotiations being sponsored by Norway aimed at overcoming Venezuela's long running economic crisis and political tug of war.The families of nine Americans jailed in Caracas are less hopeful that Saab's legal troubled can be disentangled from the furtive attempts at a détente.In addition to the Citgo 6 — who were sentenced last year to long prison sentences over a never-executed plan to refinance billions in the oil company's bonds— they include former U.S. Marine Matthew Heath who is being held on weapons charges tied to a supposed plan to sabotage refineries and two former Green Berets Caracas tied to a failed cross-border raid from Colombia to overthrow Maduro.""In a very disappointing turn of events American detainees in Venezuela are now being used as political pawns"" former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson who has traveled to Venezuela to try and secure the Americans' release said in a statement.

"Great white shark attacks are rare and when they do occur they are sometimes fatal. But attacks against the human species are often a result of mistaken identity new research published on Tuesday shows.Thestudy published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface was conducted by looking at humans and animals from a great white shark's eye view below the ocean surface. It's often been assumed that it's hard for sharks to differentiate between them but there is little research taking into account how sharks see rather than just from their perspective from underwater.Sharks according to the research have limited color perception if they are not completely color blind and have spatial resolving power that is ""considerably worse than humans."" So when they are looking for prey researchers found they more heavily rely on motion and brightness contrast.To determine how great white sharks primarily juveniles since they are most often the ones involved in human interactions might see objects when looking up from below the ocean surface researchers specifically compared video footage of rectangular floats humans swimming humans paddling surfboards and pinnipeds including sea lions and seals. The footage was filtered to mimic the sharks' visual system.And as it turns out the researchers found that juvenile great whites cannot significantly differentiate between the different life forms.

"China has launched a three-person crew for a six-month mission aboard its space station. The mission aims to set a new record for the length of time spent in space by Chinese astronauts as the country moves toward completing the orbiting structure.In this photo released by Xinhua News Agency the crewed spaceship Shenzhou-13 atop a Long March-2F carrier rocket is launched from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China's Gobi Desert Oct. 16 2021.Li Gang / APThe Shenzhou-13 spaceship carrying the three astronauts was launched by a Long March-2F rocket at 12:25 a.m. local time Saturday. It is expected to complete docking with the Tianhe module within the next six hours beginning the mission that will continue the work of the initial crew. Those crew members conducted two spacewalks and deployed a 10-meter (33-foot) mechanical arm before returning from their 90-day stay in mid-September.The new crew includes two veterans of space travel. Pilot Zhai Zhigang 55 and Wang Yaping 41 the only woman on the mission and Ye Guangfu 41 who is making his first trip to space.The crew was seen off by a military band and supporters singing ""Ode to the Motherland"" underscoring the weight of national pride invested in China's space program that has advanced rapidly in recent years.The crew's scheduled activities include up to three spacewalks to install equipment in preparation for expanding the station assessing living conditions in the module and conducting experiments in space medicine and other fields.China's military-run space program plans to send multiple crews to the station over the next two years to make it fully functional. Shenzhou-13 is the fifth mission to the structure including trips without crews to deliver supplies.When completed with the addition of two more modules - named Mengtian and Wentian - the station will weigh about 66 tons a fraction of the size of the International Space Station which launched its first module in 1998 and will weigh around 450 tons when completed.The two additional Chinese modules are due to be launched before the end of next year during the stay of the yet-to-be-named Shenzhou-14 crew.China's Foreign Ministry on Friday renewed its commitment to cooperation with other nations in the peaceful use of space.Spokesperson Zhao Lijian said sending humans into space was a ""common cause of mankind"" and China would ""continue to extend the depth and breadth of international cooperation and exchanges"" in crewed spaceflight and ""make positive contributions to the exploration of the mysteries of the universe.""China was excluded from the International Space Station largely due to U.S. objections over the Chinese program's secretive nature and close military ties prompting it to launch two experimental modules before starting on the permanent station.U.S. law requires congressional approval for contact between the American and Chinese space programs but China is cooperating with space experts from countries including France Sweden Russia and Italy. Chinese officials have said they look forward to hosting astronauts from other countries aboard the space station once it becomes fully functional.Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesPablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical adviceSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";China launches crew for six-month mission aboard its space station;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/china-launches-crew-shenzhou-13-space-station/;mindset;0.930000

He was sentenced and taken into custody on Wednesday.Sooraj stayed in the room with Uthra after the cobra bit her and went about his morning routine the next day when alerted by the woman's mother said prosecutors.""The mode of execution and the diabolic plan of the accused to murder Uthra his wife who was bedridden makes it (the case) fall into the category of rarest of rare"" said the public prosecutor who had sought the death penalty.Snake handler Vava Suresh said it was possible that Sooraj had ""inflicted pain on the reptile to provoke it to bite"" the Hindustan Times newspaper quoted him as saying.Uthra was from an affluent family but her husband a bank worker was not well off.The dead woman's parents became suspicious after Sooraj tried to take control of her property after the death.Their marriage involved a big dowry including a new car and 500000 rupees (around $20000).According to media reports Sooraj's family was charged with conspiracy after some of Uthra's gold was found buried near Sooraj's home days after the murder.Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical advicePablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";Man gets life sentence for murdering wife with a cobra;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sooraj-kumar-cobra-viper-to-kill-wife-life-sentence-india/;mindset;0.930000
"Beirut— A day of mourning has been declared in Lebanon after at least 7 people were killed and dozens injured inprotests in the capital Beiruton Thursday. The country once called the ""playground of the Middle East"" is already in the midst of a devastating economic crisis with nearly three quarters of its population living in poverty.During Thursday's deadly clashes gunmen used rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons on the streets of the capital echoing the carnage of the country's deadly civil war three decades earlier. Mariam Farhat a 45-year-old mother of five was among those killed the Associated Press reported.""We started screaming she was taken on a stretcher but did not reach the hospital"" Farhat's mother-in-law told the Associated Press. She said her youngest daughter did not know her mother had been killed. ""She is five years old. How is she going to understand?""Banks government offices and schools were closed Friday. Residents of the Beirut neighborhood where most of the fighting occurred swept up glass from the streets. Barbed wire had been installed at the entrance to the area and soldiers stood guard.Port explosionThursday's violence broke out over the investigation into themassive explosion at a Beirutport that killed over 200 people last year.Two main Shiite parties - Hezbollah and the Amal Movement - called for the demonstrations to demand the removal of the lead judge in charge of the investigation. They accused him of politicizing the probe and going after some officials instead of others.It was unclear who fired first during Thursday's clashes. Many protesters who came to the demonstration were armed according to AP. Hezbollah and the Amal Movement said they were shot at by snipers on nearby rooftops and accused the Lebanese Forces militia a Christian right-wing group of shooting first. The two groups said they were holding funerals for the dead later on Friday.Economic freefallLebanon is already going through one of the worst economic crises the world has seen since the 1800s.There are regular power blackouts and shortages of fuel and food. There is also a skills vacuum as many of the country's doctors are leaving the country to find better paid work elsewhere.Inflation is rising fast.

"A Chinese man was sentenced to death for murdering his ex-wife during her livestream a court ruled Thursday in a case that shocked the country and raised nationwide outrage over domestic violence.Amuchu a 30-year-old Tibetan vlogger known on social media as Lamu died after being doused in gasoline and set on fire by her former husband Tang Lu in September last year.She suffered burns on 90% of her body and died two weeks later BBC Newsreported.Amuchu divorced Tang  who had a history of violence towards her the court said  in June 2020 only months before she was murdered at her father's home.State-run broadcasterCCTV.reported Tang was sentenced to death for intentional homicide by a court in Aba Prefecture a remote rural region of southwest Sichuan province with a large number of ethnic Tibetan residents.State-run broadcaster CCTV reported Tang was sentenced to death for intentional homicide by a court in Aba Prefecture.CCTVHis crime ""was extremely cruel and the social impact was extremely bad"" the court statement said calling for ""severe punishment"" in accordance with the law.At the time her death triggered an online outcry over the under-reported issue of domestic violence in rural communities  especially where it affects ethnic minorities.On Douyin  China's version of TikTok  Amuchu regularly posted videos of her daily life foraging in the mountains cooking and lipsyncing to songs dressed in traditional Tibetan clothing. BBC News reported she had hundreds of thousands of followers.The mother of two children was known for her upbeat posts on rural life and was praised for not using makeup in her videos which had millions of likes BBC News reported.After her death tens of thousands of grieving followers commented on her Douyin page while millions of users on the Twitter-like platform Weibo demanded justice using trending hashtags that were later censored.China only criminalized domestic violence in 2016 but the issue remains pervasive and under-reported especially in under-developed rural communities.In one city people planning to marry can check if their partner has a history of domestic abuseAround one in four married Chinese women have experienced domestic abuse according to a 2013 survey by the All-China Women's Federation.Activists say victims' repeated complaints are often not taken seriously by police until it is too late with the issue often regarded as a private family matter in the country's conservative culture.There have also been concerns that a recent change to China's civil code  which introduced a mandatory 30-day ""cooling-off"" period for couples wishing to divorce  may make it harder for victims to leave abusive marriages.Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical advicePablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";Man sentenced to death for setting ex-wife on fire during livestream;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tang-lu-sentenced-death-setting-ex-wife-on-fire-livestream-china/;mindset;0.930000

It's often been assumed that it's hard for sharks to differentiate between them but there is little research taking into account how sharks see rather than just from their perspective from underwater.Sharks according to the research have limited color perception if they are not completely color blind and have spatial resolving power that is ""considerably worse than humans.""

The footage was filtered to mimic the sharks' visual system.And as it turns out the researchers found that juvenile great whites cannot significantly differentiate between the different life forms.

"New Delhi— India could face significant power cuts within days. Governmentdatashow that as of Thursday 116 of India's 135 coal-fired power plants had nine days' or less worth of coal left in their stocks and 84 of the plants had less than five days' worth of the fuel left to burn.Several Indian states including the one encompassing the capital city of New Delhi have raised concerns with the federal government and warned of possible power blackouts. Some states have already seen rolling power outages as plants cut their output in anticipation of coal shortages.Study: Air pollution kills 100k Indian kids annuallyCoal addictionThe specter of power cuts has highlighted the extent to which India the world's second-most populous nation still relies on coal for energy — 70% of India's electricity comes from coal-fired thermal power plants.Coal burning is one of the biggest sources of carbon dioxide emissions. It is considered the most environmentally harmful fuel to burn for power generation.Asia's coal usage challenges climate efforts02:27India is not alone however. China tops thelistof coal power producing countries followed by India and the United States.From coal to cleanIndia is Asia's third largest economy and the government has relied heavily on coal to keep that economic engine cranking as it tries to lift millions more people out of poverty.The country has already made significantprogressin transitioning from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources but experts say there's still a long way to go and it won't be an easy shift.""The coal retirement is not happening at a fast pace given that the overall demand is huge. India being a big country with the total coal capacity of more than 200 gigawatts (GW) it does not have the luxury to announce that it will phase out all coal by 2030 or 2040"" Vibhuti Garg an energy economist at the Institute for Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) told CBS News.In 2015 as part of theParis climate agreement India agreed to increase its installed electricity capacity from clean sources like solar wind hydroelectric and nuclear to 40% by 2030. It managed to hit that target this year — nine years ahead of schedule.As part of its plan to reduce coal dependency India now plans to increase the proportion of its green energy production from the current 40% (101GW) to 60% (450GW) by 2030.To help make that shift India is making huge investments in solar and wind energy. The country has increased its solar power capacity more than 11-fold over the last five years alone. But it is also looking at other technologies.Fuel from waterIndia is also aiming to outpace other countries in the production of ""green hydrogen."" With the ability to replace fossil fuels in some industries many hope that greenhydrogen— created by using renewable energy and the process of electrolysis to split the building blocks of water — will become a key clean fuel of the future.Currently the process is too expensive to scale up significantly but India is investing heavily to change that. At the recent U.N. General Assembly Prime Minister Modi said his government was working to make India the world's biggest green hydrogen hub.""For India investing in green hydrogen will be like leap-frogging"" Ulka Kelkar an economist and climate change researcher with the World Resources Institute told CBS News. ""If India becomes an early mover in this space it can prove to be a huge advantage in going green faster.""Roadblocks on the green roadDespite its significant achievements there are some big obstacles on India's road to a greener future. Storage and transmission of renewable energy is one of them.Right now India has sufficient capacity to distribute and store the limited amount of green energy it is producing. But experts say that as the country ramps up its renewable power generation storing the electricity will be one of the major challenges — but storage technology is advancing too.EPA climate fight03:08""Beyond 2024-2025 when the battery storage prices will fall that's when I feel that at least in the electricity sector we will see the share of renewable energy going up more"" Garg predicted.Another hurdle particularly for solar energy is the space required. Unlike in China which has become a leader in solar empty land is scarce in India.For India to achieve its target of net zero emissions by 2050 the country would need to devote between about 19300 and 29000 square miles of land to solar power infrastructure and another 5800 to 7700 square miles to wind energy according toestimatesby IEEFA.For now it's coalWhile India is irrefutably working to go green experts say it will realistically take decades to wean the massive country off coal completely.

Interior Minister Bassam Mawlawi told a press conference that the death toll had climbed to six. He said that some of the victims were shot in the head.Heavy fire rang out as ambulances rushed the wounded through the deserted streets a few blocks from the Palace of Justice where hundreds of black-clad protesters had gathered to demand Tarek Bitar's removal.The judge has in recent days been in the sights of the Hezbollah and Amal parties in particular for insisting on subpoenaing top officials from those groups in his probe into last year's deadly port blast.One year after Beirut explosion02:57The deaths include a 24-year-old woman who was hit in the head by a stray bullet while inside her home a doctor at the Sahel hospital in Beirut's southern suburbs told AFP.

"South Korean homeless people gather to get free lunch offered by a Christian organization in Seoul South Korea on October 13 2021.Ahn Young-joon/APSeoul South Korea— ""Squid Game"" a brutal Netflix survival drama about desperate adults competing in deadly children's games for a chance to escape severe debt hit a little too close to home for Lee Chang-keun.The show has captivated global audiences since its September debut on its way to becoming Netflix's biggest hit ever. It has struck raw nerves at home where there's growing discontent over soaring personal debt decaying job markets and stark income inequalities worsened by financial crises in the past two decades.In the dystopian horrors of ""Squid Game"" Lee sees a reflection of himself in the show's protagonist Seong Gi-hun a laid-off autoworker coping with a broken family and struggling with constant business failures and gambling problems.Netflix to edit real woman's phone number out of ""Squid Game""Seong gets beaten by gangster creditors into signing off his organs as collateral but then receives a mysterious offer to play in a series of six traditional Korean children's games for a shot at winning $38 million.The Netflix series ""Squid Game"" is played on a cell phone in a September 30 2021 photo.KIM HONG-JI/REUTERSThe South Korea-produced show pits Seong against hundreds of other financially distressed players in a hyper-violent competition for the ultimate prize with losers being killed at every round.It is raising disturbing questions about the future of one of Asia's wealthiest economies where people who once crowed about the ""Miracle of the Han River"" now moan about ""Hell Joseon"" a sarcastic reference to a hierarchical kingdom that ruled Korea before the 20th century.""Some scenes were very hard to watch"" said Lee a worker at South Korea's Ssangyong Motors who struggled with financial difficulties and depression after the carmaker laid him and 2600 other employees off while filing for bankruptcy protection in 2009.After years of protests court battles and government intervention Lee and hundreds of other Ssangyong workers returned to work in recent years. But not before a spate of suicides among co-workers and family members who were plunged into financial misery.""In 'Squid Game' you see characters scrambling to survive after being laid off at work struggling to operate fried chicken diners or working as 'daeri' drivers"" who get paid for driving drunk people home in their own cars Lee said. ""That reminded me of my co-workers who died.""Lee said he and his colleagues struggled to find work and were backlisted by other auto companies that considered them militant labor activists.A 2016 report by Korea University medical researchers said at least 28 laid-off Ssangyong workers or their relatives died of suicide or severe health problems including those linked to post-traumatic stress disorder.""Squid Game"" is one of many South Korean shows inspired by economic woes. Its dark tale of inequality and class has drawn comparisons with Bong Joon-ho's Oscar-winning ""Parasite"" another pandemic-era hit with stunning visuals and violence exposing the underside of South Korea's economic success story.Netflix tweeted Wednesday that ""Squid Game"" has become its biggest original series launch after reaching 111 million fans.South Korea's rapid rebuilding from the devastation of the 1950-53 Korean War has been spectacular - from Samsung's emergence as a global technology giant to the immense popularity of K-pop and movies that's expanding beyond Asia - though millions of South Koreans now grapple with the dark side of that rise.""Class problems are severe everywhere in the world but it seems South Korean directors and writers tackle the issue with more boldness"" said Im Sang-soo a film director.In ""Squid Game"" Seong's troubles trace back to his firing a decade earlier from the fictional Dragon Motors a nod to Ssangyong which means ""double dragon.""Hundreds of workers including Lee occupied a Ssangyong plant for weeks in 2009 to protest the layoffs before being dispersed by riot police who besieged them assaulted them with batons shields and water-cannons and dropped liquified tear gas by helicopter.That violent standoff injured dozens and is woven into the ""Squid Game"" narrative. Seong has flashbacks about a Dragon coworker killed by strikebreakers while organizing fellow game participants to create barricades with dormitory beds to block murderous sneak night attacks by more vicious opponents looking to eliminate the competition.Ultimately it's every person for themselves in a cruel battle royale between hundreds of people willing to risk even their lives for a shot at freeing themselves from the nightmare of insurmountable debts.The show features other crushed or marginalized characters like Ali Abdul an undocumented factory worker from Pakistan with severed fingers and a boss who refuses to pay him epitomizing how the country exploits some of the poorest people in Asia while ignoring dangerous working conditions and wage theft.And Kang Sae-byeok a pickpocketing North Korean refugee who had known nothing but rough life on the streets and is desperate for money to rescue her brother from an orphanage and to smuggle her mother out of the North.Many South Koreans despair of advancing in a society where good jobs are increasingly scarce and housing prices have skyrocketed enticing many to borrow heavily to gamble on risky financial investments or cryptocurrencies.Household debt at over 1800 trillion ($1.5 trillion) now exceeds the country's annual economic output. Tough times have pushed a record-low birth rate lower as struggling couples avoid having babies.Squid Game's global success is hardly a cause for pride Se-Jeoung Kim a South Korean lawyer based in Poland wrote in a Seoul Shinmun newspaper column.""Foreigners will come to you saying they too watched Squid Game with fascination and may ask whether Ali's situation in the drama could really happen in a country that's as wealthy and neat as South Korea and I would have nothing to say"" she said.Kim Jeong-wook another Ssangyong worker who spent months with Lee perched atop a chimney at a Ssangyong factory in 2015 demanding the company to rehire the fired workers said he couldn't watch Squid Game after episode one.""It was too traumatic for me"" he said.TV & StreamingMoreLatinx community remains underrepresented in television report finds""Squid Game"" becomes Netflix's biggest series launchBilly Porter: ""Dream the impossible because the impossible is possible""TV shows canceled or ended in 2021Lori Loughlin to act in first role since college admissions scandalMoreDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";"Why ""Squid Game"" is ""too traumatic"" for some South Koreans to watch";https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/squid-game-reflects-painful-reality-for-some-south-koreans/;mindset;0.930000

Deforestation in the region already releases more CO2 than the rest of the Amazon can absorb.AllRise an environmental law organization filed the official complaint at The Hague-based court Tuesday morning. They asked for legal proceedings against Bolsonaro and his administration for actions ""directly connected to the negative impacts of climate change around the world.""Did U.S. consumers help fuel the Amazon fires?The complaint accuses the Brazilian leader of waging a widespread campaign resulting in the murder of environmental defenders and of endangering the global population through emissions caused by deforestation.It harnesses the growing field of climate attribution science which allows researchers to prove a link between extreme weather events on the one hand and global heating and environmental degradation on the other.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro looks on during the Armed Forces General Officers promotion ceremony at Planalto Palace in Brasilia on December 9 2019.EVARISTO SA/GETTYThe team behind it said that Bolsonaro's administration had sought to ""systematically remove neuter and eviscerate laws agencies and individuals that serve to protect the Amazon"".Bolsonaro calls new Amazon fires a ""lie""It said that Bolsonaro was responsible for approximately 400000 hectares (about 1500 square miles) of lost rainforest each year and that he had presided over monthly deforestation rates that had accelerated by up to 88% since taking office on January 1 2019.Bolsonaro's office did not respond to a request for comment from AFP.""Consequences that arrive globally""The team of experts estimated that emissions attributable to the Bolsonaro administration due to rampant deforestation will cause over 180000 excess heat-related deaths globally this century.""In the last few years climate science has come a long way in being able to provide evidence of specific causal relationships between emissions of greenhouse gases and the consequences that arrive globally as a result"" Rupert Stuart Smith from the University of Oxford's Sustainable Law Program told AFP.While there have been at least three other complaints by indigenous groups against Bolsonaro at the ICC since 2016 organizers say this one is the first to highlight the clear link between forest loss and global human health.""What's happening in Brazil — mass deforestation — we want to understand the causal link to the global climate"" AllRise founder Johannes Wesemann told AFP.

"Great white shark attacks are rare and when they do occur they are sometimes fatal. But attacks against the human species are often a result of mistaken identity new research published on Tuesday shows.Thestudy published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface was conducted by looking at humans and animals from a great white shark's eye view below the ocean surface. It's often been assumed that it's hard for sharks to differentiate between them but there is little research taking into account how sharks see rather than just from their perspective from underwater.Sharks according to the research have limited color perception if they are not completely color blind and have spatial resolving power that is ""considerably worse than humans."" So when they are looking for prey researchers found they more heavily rely on motion and brightness contrast.To determine how great white sharks primarily juveniles since they are most often the ones involved in human interactions might see objects when looking up from below the ocean surface researchers specifically compared video footage of rectangular floats humans swimming humans paddling surfboards and pinnipeds including sea lions and seals. The footage was filtered to mimic the sharks' visual system.And as it turns out the researchers found that juvenile great whites cannot significantly differentiate between the different life forms. The silhouettes of the different objects at the surface are too similar for the animals given their reliance on motion and light.""From the perspective of a white shark...neither visual motion nor shape cues allow an unequivocal visual distinction between pinnipeds and humans"" the study says ""supporting the mistaken identity theory behind some bites.""Laura Ryan the lead author of the study said in apress releasefrom Macquarie University that surfers are the most at-risk for fatal shark bites particularly from juveniles.""We found that surfers swimmers and pinnipeds (seals and sea lions) on the surface of the ocean will look the same to a white shark looking up from below because these sharks can't see fine details or colours"" she said.Professor Nathan Hart senior author of the study said thatgreat whiteshave to learn what to eat and their diet changes as they grow and learn.

"Great white shark attacks are rare and when they do occur they are sometimes fatal. But attacks against the human species are often a result of mistaken identity new research published on Tuesday shows.Thestudy published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface was conducted by looking at humans and animals from a great white shark's eye view below the ocean surface. It's often been assumed that it's hard for sharks to differentiate between them but there is little research taking into account how sharks see rather than just from their perspective from underwater.Sharks according to the research have limited color perception if they are not completely color blind and have spatial resolving power that is ""considerably worse than humans."" So when they are looking for prey researchers found they more heavily rely on motion and brightness contrast.To determine how great white sharks primarily juveniles since they are most often the ones involved in human interactions might see objects when looking up from below the ocean surface researchers specifically compared video footage of rectangular floats humans swimming humans paddling surfboards and pinnipeds including sea lions and seals. The footage was filtered to mimic the sharks' visual system.And as it turns out the researchers found that juvenile great whites cannot significantly differentiate between the different life forms. The silhouettes of the different objects at the surface are too similar for the animals given their reliance on motion and light.""From the perspective of a white shark...neither visual motion nor shape cues allow an unequivocal visual distinction between pinnipeds and humans"" the study says ""supporting the mistaken identity theory behind some bites.""Laura Ryan the lead author of the study said in apress releasefrom Macquarie University that surfers are the most at-risk for fatal shark bites particularly from juveniles.""We found that surfers swimmers and pinnipeds (seals and sea lions) on the surface of the ocean will look the same to a white shark looking up from below because these sharks can't see fine details or colours"" she said.Professor Nathan Hart senior author of the study said thatgreat whiteshave to learn what to eat and their diet changes as they grow and learn. This could explain why juvenile sharks tend to be more commonly involved in biting humans. Adult sharks researchers said tend to have better vision and can better differentiate.""They need to develop a search image for these prey items and combine that with other sensory information"" Hart said.

"Iraqi security forces escort captured ISIS finance chief and former deputy leader Sami Jasim al-Jaburi after his arrest in an unidentified third country.Iraqi News AgencyErbil Iraq— Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi announced on Monday the capture of one of the top leaders ofISIS. Al-Kadhimi said in a Twitter post that Sami Jasim al-Jaburi the former deputy of the terror group and its head of finance was detained in a third country which he declined to name by Iraqi intelligence forces in a ""complex external operation.""Al-Jaburi born in Iraq in 1973 was a deputy toslain ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadiand is believe to have remained close to thegroup's current commanderAbu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi.Al-Jaburi was designated as a terrorist by the U.S. government and there was a $5 million reward on offer from the State Department for information leading to his arrest.Former ISIS deputy Sami Jasim al-Jaburi who most recently served as the group's head of finance is seen in the custody of Iraqi security forces after being detained in an unidentified third country.Iraqi government handoutThe Iraqi government considers al-Jaburi a key figure within the terrorist organization. After joining ISIS in the early days following its split from al Qaeda he played a central role in building ISIS' de-facto state as it seized a huge swathe of territory spanning the Iraq-Syria border between 2014 and 2018.Iraqi political analyst and security expert Fadhil Abu Ragheef told CBS News that al-Jaburi was a trusted deputy to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi the former ISIS leader who was killed in a U.S. raid in Syria in 2019.He was arrested by U.S. forces in 2005 and spent five years in a U.S.-run prison in Iraq. Following his release in 2011 al-Jaburi re-joined al Qaeda in Iraq but in 2014 he joined ISIS. Abu Ragheef said al-Jaburi looked after much of the terror group's administration security and finance before rising to become al-Baghdadi's deputy and the head of finance for ISIS.""After ISIS territories were liberated al-Jaburi escaped the region and smuggled himself to eastern Europe but he returned to the region after he failed to smuggle his family to Europe"" Abu Ragheef told CBS News.An Iraqi intelligence officer told CBS News that al-Jaburi's arrest would send an important message to ISIS' remaining leaders — that Iraq's security forces can penetrate their networks and find them no matter where they're hiding.The intelligence official added that al-Jaburi's arrest would provide insight into how ISIS funds its operations and who the group's supporters are around the world.ISIS once controlled about a third of Iraq and Syria and it used that base to plan and orchestrate terroristattacks in Europe. U.S. forces and their allies beat back the group to reclaim its territory in both countries early in 2019 but it still has active cells in Iraq Syria and elsewhere.TheISIS affiliate in Afghanistanis one of the most serious security concerns in that country — both for its new Taliban rulers and the United States and its allies.The Fight Against ISISMoreISIS bride gets 10 years for allegedly letting girl kept as slave die of thirstISIS-K is working to undermine even infiltrate the Taliban regimeTop general warns of al Qaeda resurgenceFrance says leader of Islamic State in Sahara has been killedISIS ""Beatle"" pleads guilty in connection with capture murder of AmericansMoreDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";Iraq captures ISIS finance chief and former deputy leader;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/isis-finance-chief-ex-deputy-leader-sami-jasim-al-jaburi-captured-iraq/;mindset;0.930000

"Stockholm —Three U.S.-based economists have won the 2021 Nobel prize for economics for work on drawing conclusions from unintended experiments or so-called ""natural experiments."" The winners were David Card of the University of California at Berkeley; Joshua Angrist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; and Guido Imbens from Stanford University. Their research has shed new light on such thorny issues as minimum wage hikes versus job growth and the impact of immigration on native-born workforces.The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the three had ""completely reshaped empirical work in the economic sciences.""BREAKING NEWS:The 2021 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel has been awarded with one half to David Card and the other half jointly to Joshua D. Angrist and Guido W. Imbens.#NobelPrizepic.twitter.com/nkMjWai4Gn— The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize)October 11 2021Card worked on research that used restaurants in New Jersey and in eastern Pennsylvania to measure the effects of increasing the minimum wage. He studied what happened when New Jersey raised its minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.05 using restaurants in bordering eastern Pennsylvania as a comparison group.Contrary to previous studies he and his late research partner Alan Krueger found that an increase in the minimum wage had no effect on the number of employees. Card later did further work on the issue. Overall the work concluded that the negative effects of increasing the minimum wage are small and significantly smaller than believed 30 years ago the Nobel committee said.Card also found that incomes of those who are native born in a country can benefit from new immigrants while immigrants who arrived earlier are the ones at risk of being negatively affected.Angrist and Imbens won their half of the award for working out the methodological issues that allow economists to draw solid conclusions about cause and effect even where they cannot carry out studies according to strict scientific methods.Speaking by phone from his home in Massachusetts Imbens told reporters that he had been asleep when the call came.""I was just absolutely stunned then to get a telephone call"" he said. ""And then I was just absolutely thrilled to hear the news a particular kind of hearing that I got to share this with Josh Angrist and and David Card were both very good friends of mine.""The award comes with a gold medal and 10 million Swedish kronor or a little over $1 million.Unlike the other Nobel prizes the economics award wasn't established in the will of Alfred Nobel but by the Swedish central bank in his memory in 1968 with the first winner selected a year later. It is the last prize announced each year and is formally known as the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel.Last year's prize went to two Stanford University economists who tackled the tricky problem of making auctions run more efficiently.It also created an endearing moment when one had to knock on the other's door in the middle of the night to wake him up and tell him they had won.Last week the 2021Nobel Peace Prize was awardedto journalists Maria Ressa of the Philippines and Dmitry Muratov of Russia for their fight for freedom of expression in countries where reporters have faced persistent attacks harassment and even murder.The Nobel Prize for literature was awarded to U.K.-based Tanzanian writer Abdulrazak Gurnah who was recognized for his ""uncompromising and compassionate penetration of the effects of colonialism and the fate of the refugee.""The prize for physiology or medicinewent to Americans David Julius and Ardem Patapoutianfor their discoveries into how the human body perceives temperature and touch.Three scientists wonthe physics prizefor work that found order in seeming disorder helping to explain and predict complex forces of nature including expanding our understanding of climate change.Benjamin List and David W.C.

"Pope Francis on Saturday called on lawmakers worldwide to overcome ""the narrow confines"" of partisan politics to quickly reach consensus on fighting climate change. The pope addressed parliamentarians who were in Rome for a preparatory meeting before the U.N's annual climate conference which begins in Glasgow Scotland on October 31.Francis referred to a joint appeal he and other religious leaders signed this week that calls for governments to commit to ambitious goals at the U.N. conference which experts consider a critical opportunity to tackle the threat of global warming.""To meet this challenge everyone has a role to play'' Francis told the visiting lawmakers from many countries. ""That of political and government leaders is especially important and indeed crucial.""""This demanding change of direction will require great wisdom foresight and concern for the common good: in a word the fundamental virtues of good politics'' Francis said.Francis said in a recent interview that he intended to participate in the U.N.'s upcoming COP26 conference but the Vatican announced Friday that he would not attend and the Vatican delegation would be led by the secretary of state Cardinal Pietro Parolin.No explanation was given but the 84-year-old pope underwent intestinal surgery in July. In an interview with the Spanish bishops' conference broadcast last month Francis said he was back to normal but he conditioned his presence in Glasgow on his continued recovery.The pope expressed hope Saturday that the lawmakers' efforts in view of the climate conference and beyond ""will be illuminated by the two important principles of responsibility and solidarity.""""We owe this to the young to future generations"" he said.Caring for humanity's ""common home"" Francis said ""is not just a matter of discouraging and penalizing improper practices but also and above all of concretely encouraging new paths to pursue"" that are better suited to climate-protection objectives and to contributing ""to the positive outcome of COP26.""Before his speech Francis gave a private audience to Nancy Pelosi speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.Climate ChangeMoreExtreme weather takes aim from coast to coastWhat to know about COP26 ahead of global climate summitU.N. reports record greenhouse gas levels despite COVID shutdownsWorld leaders prepare for UN climate summitHere's how climate change is hurting your healthMoreDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";Pope calls on lawmakers to quickly reach consensus on climate change fight;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pope-francis-calls-on-lawmakers-reach-consensus-fighting-climate-change/;mindset;0.930000
"Sokółka Poland— As you approach the Poland's border withBelarus an automatically-generated text message pops up on your cell phone. It warns any refugees to turn around.""The Polish border is sealed. Belarussian authorities told you lies. Go back to Minsk!"" reads the advisory adding: ""Don't take any pills from Belarusian soldiers.""On a small strip of land along the Polish-Belarusian border a battle is being waged not with guns and ammunition but with human lives.In the span of just two months more than 10000 migrants have tried to cross from Belarus into Poland — an entry point to the European Union. The migrants are mainly from Iraq and Syria but they also come from Africa and even as far away as Cuba. At least five of them have reportedly died in the last three weeks alone — victims of the dire conditions in the frozen swampland and forests between the two countries.Migrants sit on the ground after crossing the border from Belarus into Poland in the village of Usnarz Gorny Poland   September 1 2021.Czarek Sokolowski/APDetermined to keep out refugees the Polish government has deployed thousands of troops to the border erecting checkpoints and razor-wire fencing along the frontier. Poland's government has also declared a state of emergency which has effectively created a media blackout zone.Belarusian opposition leader brings fight for democracy to D.C.The European Union has accused Belarus of an organized campaign to encourage migrants from crisis regions includingAfghanistanSyriaand Iraq to fly to the country on tourist visas and then travel onward to the borders of Poland and the country's other neighbors Lithuania and Latvia. The Belarusian authorities' aim according to the EU is to create instability in the region as punishment for EU sanctions against theauthoritarian regime of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.EU leaders have called the Belarusian actions ""hybrid warfare"" against the bloc.Polish leaders accuse Belarus of ""hybrid warf...11:42Lukashenko formally announced in late May that Belarus would no longer prevent migrants from traveling on to the EU but European officials and migrants have reported overt efforts by Belarus — including travel advertising in Middle Eastern nations — to lure desperate people into the trap.On Friday Poland's government formally summoned the Belarusian charge d'affaires in the country to discuss the situation at the border.But it is the refugees caught in the middle of the diplomatic dispute and Poland has made it abundantly clear that they are unwelcome.Human rights groups accuse Poland of ""push-backs"" — essentially escorting migrants to the border and then forcing them back into Belarus which is illegal under international law. The Polish government had to amend its own laws earlier this year to be able to return migrants to the Belarusian border after they'd made it across.Kalina Czwarnóg works for the Polish human rights advocacy organization ""Ocalenie"" which has been trying to help migrants at the border. She says it has been made more difficult by Poland's policies.""Unfortunately we can't go into the zone of the emergency state we can only operate outside of it"" she told CBS News. ""So if we will be contacted by a person or by a group of people on the move that need some kind of help they give us their location and we run to the car and we go. And we try to look for them in the woods or in the swamps and if we are lucky we can meet them before the border guards.""The group's focus is to provide essentials — food water warm clothes and legal help. Every migrant is urged to sign a paper giving power of attorney to a member of an NGO and to proclaim their desire for asylum in Poland. After meeting migrants and seeing to their immediate needs Ocalenie and other NGO's call the Polish Border Guards and then the migrants fate is in the Polish authorities' hands.Near the edge of the forest in the Polish border town of Sokółka CBS News found two migrants from Cuba who had made it into the country hoping to claim political asylum in the European Union.

The Cubans claimed that if they were sent back the Belarusian soldiers on the other side would beat them and then send them right back to Poland.The Polish authorities gave them food and water. One officer reassured the weary men: ""Okay okay no Belarusia."" But then they took them away out of sight of our camera to a local processing station.Daniel Machado Pujol a Cuban hoping to gain political refuge in Europe looks at a CBS News camera from the back of a Polish Border Guard vehicle before being taken to a processing center after crossing for the third time into Poland from Belarus.CBS/Willem Jacob ArriensThe border guards insisted that they were taking the men to safety but according to the human rights groups and migrants we spoke to this is when the process of illegal push-back begins: After night falls the migrants are often forced back across the border by Polish authorities.In Białystok about 30 miles from the border inside Poland we met a Syrian refugee who said he had been told back in Syria that it was possible to go Belarus and then cross into the European Union. The man who didn't want to be identified said the supposed route into the EU was all over the news in his home country and there were travel posters and travel agents touting easy tourist visas for Belarus. He was told the journey across the border into Poland and then on to his family's final intended destination in Germany would be easy.So he and his family flew to Belarus and then drove to the Polish border. But when they made it into Poland they realized they had been sold a lie. They're still there hoping to be granted asylum.Polish human rights lawyer Marta Gorczynska has been following the border crisis since August and she says the EU must act.""We're talking about the external EU border right now it's not just the crisis that is happening at the border of Poland — it is a crisis that is happening at the external borders of the EU so the EU should act"" she told CBS News.

"In late SeptemberAfghanistan's new Taliban leaders ordered their commanders to conduct a full background check on all fighters. The sudden move was prompted by concerns that other extremist groups have infiltrated the Taliban's ranks.Senior members of the former Afghan government and one top Taliban official currently in a security role say the leader ofISIS-Khorasan(ISIS-K) a notorious terror operative whose identity has remained shrouded in mystery for years is believed to be among the infiltrators. The officials spoke to CBS News on the condition of anonymity.Some Taliban foot soldiers are believed to have abandoned the group to join ISIS-K or al Qaeda preferring an even more extreme — and brutal — interpretation of Islam but these sources say the ISIS faction is working deliberately to undermine the Taliban's authority from both inside and outside the group. That carries risks not only for Afghanistan but for the United States and its allies.Since forming in 2015 ISIS-K has carried out some of the deadliest attacks in Afghanistan. The group didn't immediately claim thedevastating bombing on Fridaythat hit a mosque in Kunduz leaving scores of people dead. But ISIS-K has a long history of attacking Afghanistan's Shiite Muslim minority and Taliban spokesman Bilal Karimi told CBS News that ISIS-K was behind the carnage.Today’s incident is part of a disturbing pattern of violence: 3rd deadly attack this week apparently targeting a religious institution. Islamic State(KP) claimed responsibility for Sunday’s incident next to a Kabul mosque. Wednesday’s attack on a madrassa in Khost unclaimed. 2/2— UNAMA News (@UNAMAnews)October 8 2021Four of ISIS-K's top commanders werekilled by U.S. dronesor Afghan security forces over four years following its founding. (ISIS-K is also known by other acronyms including ISKP.)In June 2020 the top job went to a militant known as Shahab al-Muhajir. Most assumed from his name that he was of Arab not Afghan descent. Two former high-ranking Afghan government security officials and the senior member of the current Taliban regime have told CBS News however that he is a veteran of Afghanistan's domestic insurgency and that his real name is Sanaullah. (Afghans often use only one name.)They say he's a graduate of the Kabul Polytechnic Institute who according to a voter registration card found by Afghan security forces is 31 years old. The former Afghan officials say the man now known as al-Muhajir received training in Pakistan from two different extremist groups based there including the Taliban-affiliated Haqqani network.An Afghan government identification card found and provided to CBS News by former Afghan intelligence officials shows a man named Sanaullah who is believed to be the leader of ISIS-K known commonly as Shahab al-Muhajir.CBS""Whatever his ethnicity he has ended up being much better positioned than his predecessors to revive ISKP"" Ex-Trac an organization that analyzes threats posed by extremist groups wrote in anAugust assessment. ""His taking the reins of power in mid-2020 culminated in radical change for the organization change that has seen it transitioning from a fragmented and degraded network into the aggressive phalanx it is today.""While other ISIS-K commanders have focused on seizing territory the former Afghan officials say al-Muhajir is part of a more strategic cadre that aims to undermine Afghanistan's leadership to gain freedom to operate.The former Afghan security officials say al-Muhajir has managed to keep hiding his real identity and continue operating as a Taliban imposter. One of the former Afghan government security sources said al-Muhajir had even managed to hold a meeting with Taliban deputy head of intelligence Mullah Tajmir Jawad without the official realizing he was talking to the ISIS-K leader.What we know about ISIS-K05:27A former senior Afghan intelligence officer tells CBS News that about one year ago ""after lots of hard work"" the country's security forces managed to locate al-Muhajir but the ISIS-K leader escaped capture. All they found was his national ID card — with his real name on it — and another ID identifying him as a member of the Afghan army.The other former Afghan security official says captured ISIS-K militants would routinely tell interrogators they'd met al-Muhajir but ""when we showed them photos to identify al-Muhajir they used to point the finger at the wrong person meaning even people within ISKP were meeting an imposter not the real boss.""""ISKP's leader Shahab right now is working within Taliban ranks but the Taliban don't know him"" the former intelligence official told CBS News. ""ISKP in Afghanistan is a live bomb roaming free within the Taliban.""A photo provided to CBS News by a former senior member of the Afghan government's national security community shows an Afghan national voter ID card identifying an Afghan national named Sanullah with a birthdate in 1990 who is believed to be the leader of ISIS-K known widely as Shahab al-Mujahir.CBSA senior Taliban official told CBS News on Wednesday that the new Afghan regime does have the previous government's security files on al-Muhajir but they haven't yet tracked him down.The other former Afghan official told CBS News that ISIS-K is splitting its efforts with ""some of them openly opposing the Taliban while some of them remain within the Taliban for their own interests like enemies staying in the enemy's house and looking for an opportunity 24/7.""Taliban denialSaeed Khosty spokesman for the Taliban regime's Interior Ministry told CBS News on Thursday that it was ""not true"" that al-Muhajir was operating within his group.Khosty insisted that ISIS-K was ""not as much of a threat"" in Afghanistan as reports suggest and he said media outlets were ignoring the Taliban's claims to have ""driven out"" ISIS-K fighters from strongholds east of Kabul.""Talking about ISIS threats in Afghanistan is like a propaganda for ISIS"" Khosty protested. ""This is making people confused but the level and skills of the ISIS-K threat are not at that high level.""""Room to breathe""Both the Trump and Biden administrations in defending their decisions to withdraw from Afghanistan vowed to hold the Taliban to its promise to prevent other groups namely al Qaeda and ISIS from using Afghan soil to plot attacks against America and its allies.But surging violence by ISIS-K and the group's alleged infiltration of the Taliban regime may complicate the new leaders' ability to deliver.Afghan men carry the dead body of a victim to an ambulance after a bomb attack at a mosque in Kunduz northern Afghanistan October 8 2021.AFP via Getty""The more pressure ISKP exerts on the Taliban the harder it will be for its nascent government to maintain centrifugal force. A fragmented Taliban wrought apart by in-fighting and distrusted by the communities over which it rules would give ISKP room to breathe"" Ex-Trac warned in its late-August report.While playing down the ISIS-K threat the Taliban also seems to be taking it very seriously claiming a series of raids targeting the group in recent days and vowing more to come. An internal communique from the Taliban regime's Intelligence Commission seen on Wednesday by CBS News lays out plans to target two districts east of Kabul believed to be ISIS-K strongholds. The Taliban security officers say in the document that the areas must be ""completely cleared"" of ISIS-K fighters.The threat to increase operations comes amid reports that the Taliban is indiscriminately killing men from areas they believe to be saturated with ISIS-K supporters. The Taliban has claimed that raids in recent weeks have killed ISIS-K fighters and it insists the Afghan people do not support the ISIS affiliate. But locals have reported that only civilians were killed in some of the Taliban raids and at checkpoints on major roads out of these areas.Ex-Trac said ISIS-K — which the recently ousted government estimated to have between 2000 and 3000 fighters — went quiet for a couple weeks as the Taliban reasserted control over the country in late August. The notable exception was the devastating Kabul airport bombing thatkilled 13 American troopsand 170 Afghans.Deadly attacks in Kabul kill more than 100 pe...03:39On September 18 ISIS-K fully resumed operations according to Ex-Trac with 22 attacks in just 11 days that primarily targeted the Taliban and civilians.The violence ""proves the claims wrong that the Taliban's military ascendency has ended the war in Afghanistan"" former Pakistani lawmaker Afrasiab Khattak who founded the cross-border Afghanistan Pakistan Peoples Friendship Association told CBS News.There are new attacks in Afghanistan blamed on ISIS-K almost every day. One of the most recent was a suicide bombing targeting a Kabul mosque on Sunday. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack which left at least five civilians dead. As it often does the group exaggerated the scope of the strike claiming to have killed ""dozens in the ranks of the Taliban.""""Aspirations to attack the United States""The U.S. has targeted ISIS-K with airstrikes since pulling its forces out of Afghanistan in August.Early this month Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the U.S. military would ""remain focused on ISIS-K"" to the extent possible post-withdrawal. He vowed that at ""the time of our choosing in the future we will hold them accountable for what they've done"" referring to the Kabul airport bombing.Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General Mark Milley during Congressional testimonysaid it was ""possible""the U.S. would cooperate with the Taliban at some point in the future to address the ISIS-K threat.""A reconstituted al Qaeda or ISIS with aspirations to attack the United States is a very real possibility"" Milley said. He estimated that ISIS-K would need between six months and several years for ""reconstitution.""Pentagon leaders testify on Afghanistan11:03He acknowledged that the mission to counter ISIS-K and other groups would be ""much harder now. But not impossible.""U.S. Central Command Commander General Kenneth McKenzie was asked if he was confident that the U.S. military could deny ISIS-K and other groups the ability to stage attacks from Afghan soil.""I think that's yet to be seen"" said the general.

"An explosion went off Friday among Shiite Muslim worshippers at a mosque in northern Afghanistan killing or wounding at least 100 people a Taliban police official said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast which took place in Kunduz the capital of Kunduz province butmilitants from the Islamic State affiliatein Afghanistan have a long history of attacking Afghanistan's Shiite Muslim minority.Taliban spokesman Bilal Karimi told CBS News that ISIS-K was behind the carnage which he said had claimed at least 46 lives. More than 140 others were wounded.Dost Mohammad Obaida the deputy police chief for Kunduz province said that the ""majority of them have been killed."" He said the attack may have been carried out by a suicide bomber who mingled among the worshipers.""I assure our Shiite brothers that the Taliban are prepared to ensure their safety"" Obaida said adding that an investigation was underway.If confirmed a death toll of dozens would be the highest since U.S. and NATO forces left Afghanistan at the end of August and the Taliban took control of the country. The Taliban have been targeted in a series of deadly ISIS-K attacks including shooting ambushes and an explosion at a mosque in the capital of Kabul.People view the damage inside of a mosque following a bombing in Kunduz province northern Afghanistan October 8 2021.Abdullah Sahil/APThe explosion went off during the weekly Friday prayer service at the Gozar-e-Sayed Abad Mosque. The Friday noon prayer is the highlight of the Muslim religious week and mosques are typically crowded. Witness Ali Reza said he was praying at the time of the explosion and reported seeing many casualties.Photos and video from the scene showed rescuers carrying a body wrapped in a blanket from the mosque to an ambulance. The stairs at the entrance of the mosque were covered in blood.Earlier Friday the chief Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the Shiite mosque was the target and that a ""large number"" of worshippers were killed and wounded. He said Taliban special forces had arrived to the scene and were investigating the incident.The Taliban leadership has been grappling with a growing threat from the local Islamic State affiliate known as the Islamic State in Khorasan. ISIS-K militants have ramped up attacks to target their rivals including two deadly bombings in Kabul. ISIS-K has also targeted Afghanistan's religious minorities in attacks.ISIS-K claimed responsibility for the horrific August 26 bombing that killed at least 169 Afghans and 13 U.S. military personnel outside the Kabul airport in the final days of the chaotic American pullout from Afghanistan.Since the U.S. pullout ISIS-K attacks have been mostly in eastern Afghanistan the regional base for the group and in Kabul.Ethnic Hazaras who are mostly minority Shiite Muslims make up about 6% of Kunduz's population of nearly 1 million people. The province also has a large ethnic Uzbek population that has been targeted for recruitment by the IS which is closely aligned with the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan.Friday's attack if claimed by ISIS will also be worrying for Afghanistan's northern Central Asian neighbors and Russia which has been courting the Taliban for years as an ally against the creeping ISIS-K infiltration in the area.Afghanistan: The New RealityMoreISIS-K could be able to launch attacks out of Afghanistan within a year: DOD officialHumanitarian crisis surges under Taliban ruleFormer chief negotiator for U.S. Zalmay Khalilzad sticks by his Taliban dealAmericans in Afghanistan face hard choice of dividing their familiesAfghan girls determined to return to schoolMoreDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";Afghanistan blast leaves at least 100 dead and wounded Taliban says;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/afghanistan-explosion-dead-wounded/;mindset;0.930000

"Great white shark attacks are rare and when they do occur they are sometimes fatal.

""She will be missed by all of us at Virunga but we are forever grateful for the richness Ndakasi brought to our lives during her time at Senkwekwe.""Orphaned mountain gorilla Ndakasi lies in the arms of her caregiver Andre Bauma on September 21 2021 shortly before her death.brent stirton / Getty ImagesNdakasi was only two months old when Virunga rangers found her in 2007 clinging to the body of her mother who was gunned down hours earlier by an armed militia according to the park. They took her in and transferred her to a rescue center in Goma where she first met Bauma. He held then-baby Ndakasi against his bare chest for the entire night – and a bond was formed.The gorilla rehabbed but was too vulnerable to return to the wild the park said. She was eventually transferred to the Senkwekwe Center and lived there peacefully for more than 11 years.During Ndakasi's time at the park her personality shined in several shows and films including the documentary""Virunga.""

"New Delhi— Indian police on Thursday said they had launched a murder investigation into a government minister's son who has been accused of planning a deadly vehicle attack onprotesting farmers. Eight people including four farmers were left dead on Sunday after an SUV and other vehicles slammed into the protesters on a road in Uttar Pradesh state's Lakhimpur Kheri district.Under mounting pressure from farmers protest groups and opposition politicians Uttar Pradesh police confirmed that they had registered an FIR (First Information Report) for murder against Ashish Mishra. An FIR indicates the beginning of a formal police investigation but no charges have been formally filed and Mishra was not taken into custody. His father Ajay Mishra a junior government minister is also named in the FIR but not on any specific charges.Police announced the FIR as India's top court demanded the Uttar Pradesh state government explain why it had failed after four days to make any arrests over the incident.A video shared widely online shows a vehicle convoy led by an SUV crashing into the group of protesters at high speed on Sunday as they walk calmly down a road. The incident was immediately seen as an attack on the farmers who have staged an almost year-long protest against government policies and it has sparked widespread outrage.I am now posting the most clear video of the#LakhimpurKheriMassacre.Take a look at how are farmers were brutally killed.#LakhimpurKheri#Lakhimpur_Kheri#FarmerProtest#Genocidein#Lakhimpurpic.twitter.com/HHvp80U5qL— Tehseen Poonawalla Official 🇮🇳 (@tehseenp)October 6 2021Rakesh Tikait the leader and public face of India's long-running farmer protests told CBS News that the movement was giving Uttar Pradesh authorities one week to place both Ashish Mishra who was purportedly in one of the vehicles and his father under arrest. If that doesn't happen Tikait said the farmers would stage nationwide disruptions.India's Supreme Court had asked Uttar Pradesh authorities earlier on Thursday why the police investigation had failed to make any headway.""We need to know who are the accused against whom you have registered FIR (First Information Report) and whether you have arrested them or not"" the court said ordering the government to file a status report by Friday.The driver of the lead vehicle in the convoy and two workers of India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were beaten to death by angry protesters right after the vehicles slammed into the group. Raman Kashyap a journalist also died in the violence.Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) an umbrella group representing dozens of Indian farmers unions has claimed that one of the four slain farmers was shot dead by Ashish Mishra during the incident while the three other farms were killed by the vehicles.Family members mourn over the coffin of a farmer killed on October 4 2021 when a vehicle convoy drove into a group of farmers protesting government agricultural reforms in Lakhimpur Uttar Pradesh India.ANI/Reuters""When all the farmers were gathered near the  road the son of Ajay Mishra Taini  the parliamentarian from this area and the country's junior home  minister Ashish came with his friends with a convoy of vehicles. He  left a trail of destruction behind crushing the farmers under his  vehicles"" local protest leader Jagtar Singh Bajwa told India's ANI TV network on the day the events unfolded.Protest leaders have claimed since the incident that it was a premeditated attack and the inaction by authorities for four days fueled anger and calls for the son's arrest and the father's firing from the government.Indian journalist speaks out on death threats...08:31Ajay Mishra who serves in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government as Minister of State for Home Affairs has denied the allegations.Modi whose government has refused to repeal the agriculture reforms that sparked and continue to fuel the farmers protests had not said anything about the incident as of Thursday.Rahul Gandhi leader of the Indian National Congress opposition party has dubbed Sunday's deaths murders and called the incident part of ""a systematic attack on farmers"" whom he said were being robbed of their livelihoods by the government reforms.Protesting farmers drive a tractor into a truck that was being used as a barricade by police as they make their way while marching to the capital breaking through police lines during India's Republic Day celebrations in New Delhi January 26 2021.Altaf Qadri/APThe deaths have refocused attention on the protests staged by tens of thousands of India's farmers for the past 11 months. They're demanding the complete repeal of three laws that officially hit the books in September 2020 – efforts by the government to deregulate the country's agriculture sector.The farmers say the laws will help big businesses but destroy the livelihoods of smaller farmers who make up the backbone of the country's agriculture sector which amounts to almost 15% of India's $2.9 trillion economy.The government hasn't given into the demands and although the Supreme Court in January put the implementation of the three laws on hold while it considers their validity the farmers haven't halted their protests.Sikh farmers wave a Sikh religious flag as they arrive at the historic Red Fort monument in New Delhi India January 26 2021.Dinesh Joshi/APThey've set up makeshift camps on the borders of New Delhi and have staged several large tractor-led marches into the capital city.One such march coinciding with India's Republic Day on January 26 turned deadly.The ongoing protests are one of the longest-running labor agitations India has seen in decades.

""Maybe he will still say something.""There are no formal pleas in the German legal system.Authorities say that the defendant is considered fit enough to stand trial despite his advanced age though the number of hours per day the court is in session will be limited.More than 200000 people were held at Sachsenhausen between 1936 and 1945. Tens of thousands of inmates died of starvation disease forced labor and other causes as well as through medical experiments and systematic SS extermination operations including shootings hangings and gassing.Exact numbers on those killed vary with upper estimates of some 100000 though scholars suggest figures of 40000 to 50000 are likely more accurate.""The defendant knowingly and willingly aided and abetted this at least by conscientiously performing guard duty which was seamlessly integrated into the killing system"" prosecutor Cyrill Klement told the court.A survivor of Sachsenhausen 100-year-old Leon Schwarzbaum attended the trial as a visitor.Leon Schwarzbaum center a 100-year-old Holocaust survivor shows a family picture as he talks to media prior the trial against a 100-year-old former concentration camp guard at the court in Brandenburg Germany Thursday Oct. 7 2021.Markus Schreiber / AP""This is the last trial for my friends acquaintances and my loved ones who were murdered in which the last guilty person can still be sentenced - hopefully "" Schwarzbaum who also survived the Auschwitz death camp and Buchenwald concentration camp told dpa.The executive vice president of the Auschwitz Committee expressed disappointment at the lawyer's announcement that the suspect would not comment on the allegations.""I found him surprisingly robust and present.

""Obviously however he does not want to muster the strength to remember and for the survivors of the camps and for the relatives of the murdered who have come here to hear some truth spoken this means once again a rejection a disparagement and a confrontation with the continued silence of the SS.""The opening of the trial comes a week after another the opening of another elderly concentration camp suspect's trial was disrupted.A 96-year-old former secretary for the Stutthof camp's SS commander skipped the opening of her trial at the Itzehoe state court in northern Germany.

"Moscow- Russia is once again grappling with a surge in coronavirus cases. The rate of new daily infections is currently three times higher than what the country was seeing a year ago despite vaccines now being widely available in the country.On Tuesday Russia reported 895 fatalities and 25110 newCOVID-19 infections bringing the total number of officially reported cases since the start of the pandemic to more than 7.6 million.""The increase in the incidence of COVID-19 infections has amounted to almost 31% since the beginning of September"" Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova said in a Tuesday meeting chaired by President Vladimir Putin. ""This is 3.1 times more than in the same period last year.""The rising number of infections has set alarm bells ringing. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin voiced ""serious concern"" and the head of health watchdog agency Rospotrednadzor Anna Popova described the situation as ""extremely tense"" according to the Tass news agency.More than 200000 people are currently hospitalized in Russia with COVID-19 and almost a million more are under medical watch with possible cases. Officials are worried that things are only set to get worse.""During all stages of these spikes we've never had our average daily rate exceed 30000 cases"" Golikova said. ""Now we are close to reaching this negative milestone.""A man in an ambulance arrives at a hospital for the COVID-19 patients at Kommunarka outside Moscow on Tuesday October 5 2021.

But a spike in cases has been recorded all over the country with infection rates climbing steadily in 67 of Russia's 85 regions.President Putin who has reportedly set rigid security protocols for his own entourage during the pandemic including requiring all personal contacts to quarantine for two weeks before they enter a room with him announced in September he wasself-isolating after being exposedto someone with COVID-19.""I was communicating all day with a person who got sick. He felt that he was sick only the next day. It was an asymptomatic case but he got sick anyway albeit the temperature was low and he had it for two days so that was it"" Putin said during the meeting on Tuesday which was carried by state TV.His spokesperson Dmitry Peskov announced earlier that the president was no longer self-isolating.""I've encountered infected people sick employees but I've escaped. I did not get sick anyway and I hope this does not happen but I understand that Sputnik has played its role"" Putin added urging Russians to seek booster shots of the Russian-made Sputnik Vvaccine.Russia registered its first vaccine in August last year after only small-scale phase 1 and 2 trials — far faster than the vaccines approved in the U.S. and Europe — but it didn't become widely available until the beginning of 2021 due to production issues.But even with clinics across the country offering Sputnik V doses to anyone willing to have them vaccine uptake has lagged in Russia thanks largely to poor communication from authorities and mistrust among Russians who believe the shot was approved too quickly.A medical worker holds an ampoule with the Sputnik Light COVID-19 vaccine at a COVID-19 vaccination center in Moscow on October 5 2021.Getty ImagesThe government has managed to get more people vaccinated over the summer by making it mandatory for certain groups including service and retail workers. Moscow the capital city trialed a mandate for residents to show vaccine certificates to enter cafes and other public places for several weeks in July and obliged businesses to get at least 60% of their staffs vaccinated.But as those mandates ended the vaccination campaign appears to have stalled again. Several regional governors said on Monday that vaccination rates had slowed significantly. Officials are proposing various ways to get more people vaccinated from car raffles to making the shots mandatory for students and other groups.As of Tuesday 42.2 million Russians were fully vaccinated which is about 29% of Russia's total population. Another 5 million are waiting to receive their second dose. In the United States by comparison about 56% of the overall population is fully vaccinated.""To achieve the herd immunity that we set for ourselves we still need to vaccinate 35.9 million more people and re-vaccinate 7.6 million people who were sick more than six months ago or received their shots more than six months ago"" Golikova said on Tuesday.""As of now about 2% of the vaccinated get sick"" Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said on Monday according to Tass.

"An injured lion is seen on a farm outside Bloemfontein South Africa in an image posted to Facebook by the Bloemfontein Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA). The group said it had to euthanize 30 captive-bred lions after fire swept through the compound and the owner failed to provide care for the animals.Facebook/Bloemfontein SPCAJohannesburg— Thirty captive-bred lions have been euthanized after they were found starving and untreated for serious injuries sustained when a wildfire swept through their compound in South Africa. One animal welfare charity called it ""one of the worst cases of animal abuse"" they'd ever seen.Inspectors working for a South African branch of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) say the horrific abuse of 59 lions was discovered on a farm just outside Bloemfontein the provincial capital of the Free State province in the heart of the country.""The owner knew the lions got injured by the fires. For 5 days they didn't administer any medical treatment. We had no option but to obtain a warrant to enter the property"" the group said in a post on Facebook. ""What we found shocked us to the bone.""The lions had been unable to escape the flames.* 30 CAPTIVE LIONS EUTHANISED *
 
Fire is one of the worst threats to any farm and worse when it is a captive-bred lion...Posted byBloemfontein SPCAonSaturday October 2 2021""They all laid in one spot with their paws turned upwards"" reads the post which included images of the wounded animals. ""Their fragile bodies were burnt and their faces carried the devastating scars of the flames just days ago.""Some of the lions were so weak they couldn't stand up and they were so famished that three of them turned on one of their own killing and eating it.Officers got a court order to search the property after reports of suspected abuse at the farm. Vets from the SPCA have been treating the injured animals for days now but 30 of them were beyond help and had to be put down.""The owner wasn't bothered to be present during any time of the inspection of the injuries nor during the euthanasia"" the SPCA said on Facebook. ""He was laughing when he was issued a warning and we didn't see him again. We issued multiple warnings for lack of water and shelter as we conduct daily inspections at the farm. The owner refuses to comply with any one of our warnings. He refuses to spend any money on these lions.""The property owner has been charged with animal abuse for failing to provide the lions with medical attention.Inspectors continue to visit the farm regularly and they're making sure the animals get food and water and tending to their wounds. Senior SPCA Inspector Reniet Meyer told CBS News that the organization would continue to monitor the lions until the court hearing and take further legal action if the abuse continues.This latest incident has once again raised the issue of the legality of captive lion breeding in South Africa. At least 12000 lions are kept in captivity in the country four times more than its wild population. Every stage of a captive lion's life can be used legally to make money.Africa's lion hunting02:24Cubs are separated from their mothers and kept in petting zoos for tourists. Adult lions are used for breeding andcanned hunting tours— where they're released into enclosed areas so hunters are guaranteed a kill. And when the lions die their bones are sold through a quota system for use primarily in Asian medicines and ornaments.It's believed that the owner of the farm in Bloemfontein may have neglected to get the lions medical attention after the fire so that they would die ""naturally"" and he could then sell their bones for a profit which wouldn't have been legal in a case of neglect.""I have never been this angry in my 30 years at the Bloemfontein SPCA"" Meyer wrote in the Facebook post. ""The lion has huge status and as a country we are supposed to be proud of our indigenous animals but we have failed them. We cultivated an industry legal or illegal that misuses our animals for entertainment like hunting bone trade poaching circus tricks cub petting or keeping them in zoos or as pets. This must stop.""Born in captivity unable to escape a devastating fire and now battling to overcome serious injuries — even the lions who survive this tragedy have never known freedom and they likely never will.CBS News' Nicky Parkin and Sarah Carter contributed to this report.Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesPablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical adviceSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";30 lions euthanized as devastating animal abuse uncovered on a farm;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lions-euthanized-south-africa-bloemfontein-animal-abuse-neglect/;mindset;0.930000

The next day Chinese planes flew 39 more sorties. Sunday saw 16 more flights all following a similar path. On Monday Taiwan's defense ministry said another 52 Chinese military planes had entered the island's air defense zone — by far the most ever in a single day — bringing the total over four days to 145 flights.Taipei has scrambled its own aircraft in response issued radio warnings and deployed air defense missile systems as it monitors the Chinese aircraft. Those planes included Shenyang J-16 fighter jets considered a core element in China's military strength along with Sukhoi SU-30 fighter jets and Xian H-6 twin-engine bombers which analysts expect to become central to China's bomber force in the 2030s. Shaanxi Y-8 ASW turbo transport submarine hunters and Shaanxi KJ-500 early warning aircraft were also on display testing Taiwain's resolve to defend its airspace.Taiwan and its approximately 24 million people — a population on par with Australia's — consider the island a sovereign nation. The U.S. and its allies try to walk an incredibly fine line: A pledge to defend Taiwan from external threats is literally written into U.S. law but Washington also does not treat Taiwan as an entirely independent nation.Under the 1979Taiwan Relations Act passed by the U.S. Congress after Washington switched official diplomatic recognition to Beijing from Taipei Washington is obligated to support Taiwan's defense capabilities against China.In August the Biden administration approved its first arms sales to Taiwan — a $750 million proposal that includes howitzer artillery units armored vehicles and machine guns. The Trump administration in 2020approved a $1.8 billion arms dealto Taiwan. Past sales have also included fighter jets and missiles.This year the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked Taiwan as the most democratic country in East Asia and the 11th most democratic in the world.

"Ahmad Mukhtar has been a CBS News producer and reporter in Afghanistan since 2009. He is currently based outside the country.In early May I stood on the rooftop of Kabul's Serena hotel discussing with colleagues how soon the Taliban might arrive in the Afghan capital. I was optimistic that ongoing peace talks in Qatar would produce a result. In the worst-case scenario of a complete American withdrawal most people including myself believed it would still take the Taliban a few years to overrun Kabul.By early August  I was less optimistic. I told a colleague that the collapse of one provincial capital would likely lead to a takeover of Kabul. But I didn't expect it tohappen so fast. The Taliban seized control of 33 ofAfghanistan's 34 provinces in just one week — in some cases without a fight.CBS News producer Agnes Reau takes a selfie with fellow producer Ahmad Mukhtar in Kabul.CBS/Agnes ReauOn the night of August 14 I couldn't sleep as we waited for news of the Taliban's arrival in Kabul city. It was my second time witnessing the Islamic extremists' takeover of Kabul.I was in the 3rd grade in 1996 when the group seized Kabul the first time. I remember my parents decided to move us all to my uncle's house in a different part of the city. My first interaction with a Talib was when one confiscated a bunch of flowers I was carrying to school for teacher's day.25 years later I found myself reporting on the Taliban's sudden march back to power after two decades of war that claimed  hundreds of thousands of lives left many more maimed and millions displaced. I struggled to answer a simple question: Was it worth it?U.S. war effort in Afghanistan ""marked by many failures""On the morning of August 15 a senior aide in the Afghan national security advisor's office assured me that an agreement had been reached between the Taliban and the government and the Taliban would not enter Kabul. An hour later gunfire was heard in the city and a group of people carrying white Taliban flags were spotted outside the presidential palace. The situation was changing fast.Taliban members are seen just outside Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul Afghanistan as thousands of Afghans rush to flee the capital city August 16 2021.Haroon Sabawoon/Anadolu Agency via GettyA group of westerners including journalists decided to head for the airport or to the nearby Baron hotel.Our team left the Serena hotel in the late afternoon and found the streets largely empty. At the Baron it was chaos as journalists officials and Afghans hoping to get U.S. special visas poured in.Journalists arriving just half an hour after us said they'd encountered Taliban fighters on the streets. By that night the Taliban had seized the presidential palace. The capital was back in Taliban hands after more than 20 years.During our few days at the Baron hotel the sound of gunfire and the buzz of helicopters and planes coming in and out of the airport were constant. Images of Afghancivilians desperately clinging toa U.S. C17 military plane and falling off it after it took off haunted my mind.WorldView: Afghan teen dies in fall from plan...03:09Those images will remain a shameful stain in both U.S. and Afghan history books.I spent the next two days at the Baron in shock. I couldn't sleep but I kept busy gathering whatever information I could as we waited for an evacuation flight. Late on the afternoon of August 17 we left the Baron hotel and headed for the military side of Kabul airport.Our CBS News crew boarded a C17 in the early hours of August 18 along with about 300 others including women children and elderly Afghans. The three-hour flight to Doha was freezing cold — the cavernous planes are nothing like passenger jets — but everyone slept after days of exhaustion.CBS News' Ahmad Mukhtar looks at his phone as other members of the CBS News team rest on the floor of a building at the U.S. al-Udeid Air Base in Doha Qatar after arriving on an evacuation flight from Kabul Afghanistan August 18 2021.CBS/Agnes ReauMost of the people on the plane had packed decades of life and memories into a backpack or suitcase to make the last-minute escape. They were traumatized but grateful to be among the lucky ones reaching safety.I was shocked by how quickly the Afghan government and its 300000-plus security forces had collapsed but mostly I was exhausted. I hadn't yet felt the pain of losing my country. I felt numb.After a night of sleep however I started to feel the pain and the nightmares began.The images of people flocking to Kabul's airport became depressing and then unbearable. They showed constant gunfire; children and infants crying even screaming in panic; young women and men crying and begging American troops to let them inside; and then the video of a tiny newborn baby just 16 days old beingpassed over razor wire to U.S. soldiers.An Afghan baby's harrowing escape to the U.S....01:43I asked myself how a parent could do that. As a father I couldn't imagine it. But only the infant's parents really understand the pain. I'm not an emotional person but I locked myself in a bathroom and screamed and cried until I couldn't anymore. But the worst was yet to come.On August 27 four days before the U.S. withdrawal was completed a suicide bomber blew himself up outside a gate to Kabul airport where thousands had gathered to escape the Taliban.Covering the disaster from Doha at first I didn't want to look at the images. But it was my job to look. I had to help figure out what happened. Were all the videos and pictures flooding social media really from the airport attack? How big was the blast? How many people might have been killed or injured? Were they all civilians? Were there kids and women among the casualties?Marine speaks about deadly Kabul attack04:50The blast killed 13 U.S. troops and 170 Afghan civilians including many women and children. The scene looked like a butcher's yard. Watching all the images made me physically sick. A colleague called me to her hotel room where our correspondent was also present for an editorial discussion. She must have noticed something was wrong and she asked me if I was okay.I broke down in tears. She hugged me and I cried and then she suggested I go for a walk around the hotel. That day I had the worst headache I've ever experienced and that night I cried until I fell asleep. The nightmares continued.On August 29 anAmerican drone strikenear Kabul airport killed an entire family. Seven children including a 2-year-old girl were among the victims. Every time I looked at her picture my own daughter who had just turned two would come to my mind.

But I've been inundated by dozens of phone calls and messages from friends and extended family members still in Afghanistan. They all say the same thing: ""You worked with Americans help us get inside the airport and get out of Afghanistan.""Again and again I've had to explain that I'm just a journalist and I can't help. Many got angry. Some have stopped answering their phones which could mean anything. I want to apologize to everyone that I couldn't help or whose calls I couldn't even answer. I am sorry.For most of the world the collapse of Afghanistan was fleeting news. Next year many journalists are likely to receive awards for their reporting on it. But for myself and countless other Afghan journalists the collapse of the democratic republic of Afghanistan was a deeply personal story and it has taken a toll.CBS News producer Ahmad Mukhtar center assists correspondent Roxana Saberi as they interview a young Afghan girl who lost a leg in one of the many bombings to plague her country.CBS/Agnes ReauA friend and fellow journalist once said that being an Afghan journalist is like telling the story of a fire tearing through your own home. You relay the details to the world as flames consume each part of your house while your family is stuck inside and you can't help them.While we were in Doha watching my country crumble the mental anguish pushed me many times to consider quitting news altogether.

"The families of two French fishermen who died when their trawler sank in mysterious circumstances off the English coast 17 years ago said on Monday they were experienced sailors and would never have compromised safety on board.Yves Gloaguen and Pascal Le Floch whose bodies were recovered by UK search and rescue teams were among five crew members who died when the Bugaled Breizh sank on January 15 2004.A coroner's inquest in London is looking into the tragedy and their families' claims that a British or U.S. submarine may have become caught in the ship's nets and dragged it down.A picture taken on July 13 2004 shows the wreckage of French trawler ""Bugaled Breizh"" installed at a barge as it is being towed and escorted by military ships towards a French military port of Brest.FRED

would go to sea during the school holidays... we would never have imagined such a brutal even violent death"" they added.Gloaguen 44 skippered the trawler and was 'jolly"" and a ""joker"" but ""serious when he went to sea"" his sister said.""He would have never taken risks to put his men and his ship in danger"" she added.Remy Gloaguen brother of a missing sailor of the sunken ship Bugaled

Getty ImagesThierry Lemetayer said his father Georges 60 who also perished in the sinking began working on trawlers at the age of 13 and was the family's only breadwinner.He remembered his father talking in a matter-of-fact way about a spate of accidents between fishing boats and submarines expressing hope the problems could be solved.""It hasn't obviously changed quickly enough"" he added.BBC News reportsthat Lemetayer said he hoped the inquest would ""light a little red light in the heads of European submarine commanders so they take into account other boats when doing their exercises.""""They're not out for revenge""The Bugaled Breizh  ""Children of Brittany"" in the local Breton language  was based in Loctudy in the Finistere region of northwest France.It went down off the coast of Cornwall in southwest England in less than a minute in relatively good weather.Yves Gloaguen and Le Floch's bodies were recovered by UK authorities while that of another crew member Patrick Gloaguen 35 was found in the wreck during salvage operations.The bodies of Lemetayer who was the ship's chief engineer and Eric Guillamet 42 have never been found.French courts spent years investigating the sinking which took place near where NATO and Royal Navy exercises were being held but the probe was inconclusive.Judge Nigel Lickley told the hearing on Monday that three submarines were in the vicinity: the closest was a Dutch submarine Dolfijn which surfaced after the first distress call.A German submarine U22 was also on the surface and a British vessel he added.Lickley said the resumed inquest ""should consider in proper detail"" how it sank and ""as part of that exercise we should look at whether any submarines might have been involved""BBC News reported.Speaking before the hearing Thierry Lemetayer told reporters: ""If the British Ministry of Defence or NATO says 'we did cover up things we apologise and we'll sort it out' I'll go home I won't bother anyone and you'll never hear from me again.""Lawyer Dominique Tricaud who represents Lemetayer's family told AFP the proceedings ""give us very great hope"".""The families think that the (British submarine) HMS Turbulent was responsible for the sinking and are waiting for the trial to prove it"" he added referring to the inquest.""They're not out for revenge but can't grieve on a state lie.""Former commanders to provide evidenceThe former commander of HMS Turbulent Captain Andrew Coles will give evidence on October 12 about the vessel's location on the day the Bugaled Breizh went down.A senior officer from the Dolfijn will also give evidence.Britain's Ministry of Defence and the Royal Navy have both denied claims that one of its submarines was involved in the sinking.In 2006 the French Marine Accident Bureau concluded that the sinking was an accident most likely caused by one of the boat's trawler net cables snagging on the seafloor.Other scenarios such as a collision with a freighter have been ruled out.The inquest into Yves Gloaguen and Le Floch's deaths began in Cornwall in 2020 but was adjourned due to Covid-19 restrictions and transferred to London.Trending

"Paris— An independent inquiry into alleged sex abuse of minors by French Catholic priests deacons and other clergy has found some 216000 victims from 1950 to 2020 a ""massive phenomenon"" that was covered up for decades by a ""veil of silence.""The landmark report released Tuesday after two and a half years of investigations follows widespread outrage over a string of sexabuse claims and prosecutions against Church officialsaround the globe. But as CBS News correspondent Chris Livesay reports the French inquiry involves not only the latest revelations about abuse by Catholic clergy but possibly highest number of victims ever identified by reports and investigations that have been carried out worldwide.When lay members of the Church such as teachers at Catholic schools are included the number of child abuse victims climbs to 330000 over the seven-decade period.France's Catholic bishops asked the victims for forgiveness.

"America won the race to the moon but Russia still proudly claims the most space ""firsts"" including the first satellite the first man in space the first woman the first spacewalk the first multi-member crew and the first space station.Now with commercial spaceflight blasting off in the United States Russia began a mission to chalk up another first Tuesday launching a Russian actress and director to the International Space Station to film scenes for a feature-length movie — ""The Challenge"" — about a medical emergency in orbit.Thirty-seven-year-old actress Julia Peresild and director Klim Shipenko lifted off aboard a Soyuz spacecraft along with veteran cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov.Soyuz MS-19 spacecraft carrying crew made up of Russian cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov film director Klim Shipenko and actress Yulia Peresild blasts off to the International Space Station from the launchpad at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on October 5 2021 in this still image taken from video.Roscosmos / Handout via ReutersWith Shkaplerov at the controls flanked on the left by Shipenko and on the right by Peresild the Soyuz MS-19/65S spacecraft atop a Soyuz 2.1a rocket launched right on time from Site 31 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan just before 5 a.m. EDT.In so doing the Russian space agency Roscosmos sought to upstage any western actors who might be considering a shoot in space. NASA and its partners are not currently planning any such mission officials say despite unsubstantiated media reports claiming Tom Cruise is considering such a project.Russian actress Yulia Peresild left Russian cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov center and producer-director Klim Shipenko pose outside a Soyuz simulator at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center near Moscow. Scheduled for launch Tuesday Peresild and Shipenko plan to film scenes from a movie about a medical emergency aboard the International Space Station.RoscosmosBut non-government space missions are now a reality thanks to SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket and available-for-hire Crew Dragon capsules along with commercially developed sub-orbital spacecraft owned by Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos.Both billionaires flew to space this summer and both are on the verge of full-scale commercial operations. William Shatner who became a cultural icon playing Star Trek's intrepid Captain Kirkplans to blast off aboard a Bezos-owned New Shepard rocketOct. 12 for a sub-orbital up-and-down trip to the edge of space.A SpaceX Crew Dragon carried four private citizens on a more ambitious flight to orbit last month and a second commercial flight this one sponsored by Houston-based Axiom Space will carry four private citizens to the space station early next year.As for the Russian movie mission Peresild said in an earlier translated Instagram post that the crew was ready. ""Even though we are of course nervous"" she said. ""And that's why we support each other all the time. No one had this experience yet. It's always difficult and scary to be pioneers but it's very interesting!""Peresild left Shkaplerov center and Shipenko review training materials before heading to the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan for launch.RoscosmosIf all goes well Shkaplerov will monitor an automated two-orbit  rendezvous with the International Space Station docking at the Russian  Rassvet module at 8:12 a.m. about three hours after launch.Standing  by to welcome them aboard will be French station commander Thomas  Pesquet and his three SpaceX Crew Dragon crewmates — Shane Kimbrough  Megan McArthur and Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide — along with Oleg  Novitskiy Pyotr Dubrov and NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei who rode to  orbit last April aboard the Soyuz MS-18/64S spacecraft.Peresild and Shipenko plan to spend 12 days aboard the space station filming in the Russian segment of the lab before returning to Earth in the Soyuz MS-18 spacecraft with Novitskiy who will be wrapping up a 190-day mission.Shkaplerov will remain aboard the station and return to Earth next March or April aboard the MS-29 spacecraft with Dubrov and Vande Hei who will have logged around 330 days — almost a full year  in orbit — since launch last April 9.In ""The Challenge"" Peresild will play a Russian doctor sent to the station to treat a critically ill cosmonaut. Shkaplerov Novitskiy and Dubrov will assist and presumably play small roles in the drama. Shipenko will be responsible for lighting makeup and camera operation.The movie is a joint project between Roscosmos the state-owned Channel One Russia and the Yellow Black and White film studio.In remarks provided by Channel One Shipenko was asked about Tom Cruise. The director said talk of a flight by the American actor prompted the Russian team to ""speed up the production the preparation process.""Shipenko said Cruise would have made a great addition to ""The Challenge"" cast.Peresild will ride into orbit strapped into the right seat of the crew's Soyuz MS-19/65S spacecraft.Roscosmos""He would've made a great American astronaut helping our heroine meet  the challenge"" said Shipenko. ""It would've been great. This type of  creative collaboration would've been akin to the Apollo-Soyuz docking.  Too bad that Tom Cruise isn't going to space right now that we won't  meet him there.""While Shipenko and Peresild presumably will be  welcome to visit the American segment of the station in their spare  time filming will take place mostly in the Russian segment made of  the Poisk and Rassvet docking modules the Zarya and aft Zvezda modules  and the newly arrived Nauka multi-purpose laboratory module.""This job would've been enormous even on Earth"" Peresild said.  ""We'll have ten days. But it won't be like ten regular 12-hour shooting  days rather like two to three hours a day when the cosmonauts will be  able to work with us. The rest of time Klim and I will be shooting with  only me in the frame.""Our only task out there is shooting the film without interfering with the crew.""Peresild  and Shipenko were assigned to the Soyuz MS-19/65S crew in May selected  from a list of candidates after an ""open competition"" at the end of  2020 Roscosmos said. The two were selected ""based on the results of  medical and creative selection.""Training for the Soyuz flight began in June.""We have received safety training"" Peresild said. ""We have also received emergency training. Our duties will be simple: we mustn't break anything. We mustn't prevent the crew from following the schedule or distract the ISS crew members' attention either.""Shipenko was assigned the left seat in the Soyuz capsule a position normally held by a professional cosmonaut or astronaut extensively trained to assist the commander and able to take over in an emergency. Peresild was assigned the right seat which requires less hands-on training in critical systems.Shipenko left Peresild and Shkaplerov discuss their flight during a Russian talk show.RoscosmosNeither Peresild nor Shipenko had any aerospace experience prior to  their selection and not everyone in the Russian space establishment was  on board with the assignments.Sergei Krikalev one of Russia's  most respected cosmonauts a Hero of the Russian Federation a  six-flight veteran and then director of the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training  Center reportedly protested the mission apparently because civilian  passengers force highly trained professional cosmonauts to wait longer  for a flight.He was not alone in his concern.""A cosmonaut prepares for flight for many years and when the left or right seat of a Soyuz is given to a passenger this pushes back the timing of an expedition into orbit for someone"" retired cosmonaut Sergei Zhukov was quoted by The Times of London.The Russians plan another commercial flight before the end of the year launching Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa his assistant Yozo Hirano and cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin for another 12-day visit brokered by the company Space Adventures.All three plan to return to Earth aboard their Soyuz MS-20/66S spacecraft on December 20.That flight will be followed by yet another commercial SpaceX Crew Dragon flight in February a mission mounted by Axiom that will carry retired astronaut Mike Lopez-Alegria and three wealthy crewmates to the outpost for a 10-day stay.NASA is making room in the space station schedule for up to two commercial flights per year by SpaceX Crew Dragons and Boeing's not-yet-operational Starliner capsule.Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical advicePablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsWilliam HarwoodBill Harwood has been covering the U.S. space program full-time since 1984 first as Cape Canaveral bureau chief for United Press International and now as a consultant for CBS News.

"Daniel Harrison who has autism recently wrote down two wishes – and one of them came true.""Daniel for the first time was asked at his special needs school to write two things that he'd like to achieve"" Daniel's dad Kevin Harrison told CBS News. ""His first was learning to drive and the second thing – which surprised us – was 'make some friends' because we didn't understand that he understood the theory of friendship.""Harrison who is from Nottingham England said children on the autism spectrum often want to play alone and Daniel has never expressed wanting friends. ""So that shocked us to the core really"" he said.Daniel’s my son. Profoundly Autistic. Hasn’t one friend. It’s his birthday today. In his ECHP he wrote that his two wishes were to learn to drive and make friends 😣 Please wish him a happy birthday. Please show him you care. Please share.  ##happybirthday#autism#rtpic.twitter.com/Psu97TSj6g— Kev #bekind (@kevharrison_)September 29 2021Harrison often shares updates about Daniel on social media and has gained a small following for his autism awareness posts on Twitter. But one post on Daniel's 15th birthday stood out.""Daniel's my son. Profoundly Autistic. Hasn't one friend. It's his birthday today"" Harrison wrote encouraging people to wish him a happy birthday and show him they care.The post began racking up likes and replies snowballing until it was the number one trending topic on Twitter for the U.S. ""I'm sitting there thinking 'What on Earth have I done?'"" Harrison said. ""And a lot of that was down to Mark Hamill from 'Star Wars.'""Hamill known for his portrayal of Luke Skywalker was one of the first celebrities totweet a happy birthday messageto Daniel. His tweet alone received more than 17000 likes.Harrison listed Russell Crowe Sharon Stone and Ariel Winter as other celebrities who tweeted to Daniel – but many of the replies were from parents of children who also have special needs.""He's got four friends in Minnesota and one with#autismwhose name is Daniel too"" tweetedSheletta Brundidge sharing a photo of herself and her son.""Hey Daniel this is my son Jacob also autistic on his birthday last month""wrote another dadwho also shared a photo. ""I'm sure he would love to be your friend if you met provided you don't mind hearing a whole lot about superheroes.  Hope you had a wonderful day.""Harrison was shocked by the overwhelming response – but knew why the story resonated with so many. ""People want to be loved don't they? People want to be liked. It's a universal feeling"" he said.""I think it's a good news story because the whole world right now is polarized"" Harrison said. ""Everywhere there's no middle ground. Yet we found with Daniel's tweet and the story that there's a lot of beautiful lovely people in the world.""The dad said some of the responses he showed Daniel made him jump for joy. ""It made me happy for Daniel but you know it's made me happy for parents and families and friends of autistic people across the globe"" he said.As for Daniel's other wish – to drive a car – Harrison says Daniel likes to play ""Mario Kart"" on Nintendo and that's as close as he'll get to driving for now.He hopes the countless people who heard about Daniel's story remember one thing: ""Don't ever feel like you're alone. Because I felt like that and I know other families will. You're not alone.

"New Delhi —India's Supreme Court approved Monday a government plan to pay only 50000 Indian rupees approximately $674 as compensation to families of all those who died ofCOVID-19.Families of the more than 448000 people who have officially died of COVID-19 in India and also of those who may die of the illness in future are expected to benefit though there have beenreportsthat the unofficial death toll could be much higher.The Supreme Court's order came on the back of two petition filed in June this year by advocates Gaurav Kumar Bansal and Reepak Kansal who had sought a compensation of 400000 rupees — approximately $5392 — for every COVID victim.The petitioners had argued that since the government had officially declared the coronavirus pandemic as a disaster under the Disaster Management Act of 2005 the federal government was bound by the law to provide compensation to those who died during the disaster.The court then asked the federal government for a response and to frame guidelines for the compensation and left it to the ""wisdom"" of the National Disaster Management Authority to set the amount.In its response the government in June argued that granting 400000 rupees was ""beyond fiscal affordability"" of states since funds were needed for otherpandemicpurposes too. The court then gave more time to the government to fix an amount.Last month the federal government told the Supreme Court that it was instead ready to pay the COVID-19 victims' families 50000 rupees as compensation from state disaster response funds.On Monday a Supreme Court bench of Justices M. R. Shah and A. S. Bopanna approved that amount in their ruling.""We know the government has spent a lot of money in managing the pandemic. But we still think the government should have paid 400000 rupees compensation to every affected family according to the law. Or they could have given a higher amount to the poor families and less to the well-to do. They could have bettered it"" Gaurav Kumar Bansal one of the petitioners told CBS News' partner network the BBC.The Supreme Court has insisted that the compensation should be paid within 30 days of a family submitting a claim for which the government has laid out a process. Families would need to fill out a form and submit documents like death certificates in order to claim the cash. If every family who has lost someone actually gets the compensation it will cost the provincial governments more than $300 million.Since there may be tens of thousands of those who died at home and whose families did not acquire a death certificate or whose death certificates did not mention COVID-19 as a cause of death the court has asked the government to allow such people to get their records corrected.India is the second-worst affected country by the COVID-19 pandemic with more than 33.8 million cases and more than 448000 deaths only behind the U.S. which has reported more than 43 million cases and 700000 deaths.Most of India's cases and deaths were reported during thedeadly second waveof the pandemic around May when the country's healthcare system was brought to its knees. But for the past few months as the new infections decreased the country has eased most restrictions on travel and businesses.Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesPablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical adviceGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";India to pay $674 compensation to COVID-19 victims;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-india-victims-compensation-674-dollars/;mindset;0.930000
"Moscow— The Russian military said Monday that it had successfully test-fired ahypersonic ""Tsirkon"" missilefrom a submarine for the first time. The high-tech missile is a key component of what President Vladimir Putin touts as Russia's new ""invincible"" generation of weapons.Hypersonic missiles fly much faster and are more agile than standard ones making them much more difficult for missile defense systems to stop. The U.S. militaryconducted its first flight testof a hypersonic missile system in 2011.North Korea claims successful hypersonic missile testThe missile was launched from the Severodvinsk nuclear submarine from a depth of 131 feet and hit a test target in the Barents Sea the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement accompanied by a grainy video showing missile flares lighting up the night sky.An image from video provided by the Russian Ministry of Defense on October 4 2021 shows what Moscow claims was its 1st successful test launch of a submarine-fired hypersonic ""Tsirkon"" missile.Reuters/Russian Ministry of DefenseTsirkon hadbeen test-firedpreviously from the ocean surface by a navy frigate most recently in July. According to Putin the missile can fly at nine-times the speed of sound and has a range of 620 miles.Tsirkon was unveiled by Putin along with an array of other ""unparalleled"" weapons during an annual address to the nation in 2018. He boasted then that Russia's new weapons systems could ""reach anywhere in the world"" and would be capable of evading U.S. missile defenses.""They need to take account of a new reality and understand... [this] is not a bluff"" Putin said of the U.S. and its allies in that speech.Among the other projects revealed at the time was the Avangard hypersonic boost-glide vehicle the air-launched Kinzhal nuclear-capable ballistic missile and the long-range nuclear-capable cruise missile Burevestnik. Some Western experts have questioned the real capabilities of these developmental weapons as well as their production value but the Russian military appears to be forging ahead regardless and claiming progress.Avangard was officiallyadded to Russia's arsenal in 2019. A prototype of the Burevestnik which NATO countries call the SSC-X-9 Skyfall is believed to have crashed during secret engine tests in Russia's Arctic in August 2019 exploding during efforts to recover it from the sea andkilling five scientists in the process.Previous tests of the weapon were also reportedly unsuccessful.Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu has said that tests on the Tsirkon system are to be completed by the end of this year and he expects the weapon to be commissioned by the Russian Navy in 2022 to arm cruisers frigates and submarines.Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical advicePablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";Russia claims 1st successful hypersonic missile test launch from a sub;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-hypersonic-missile-tsirkon-submarine-test-launch/;mindset;0.930000

"Great white shark attacks are rare and when they do occur they are sometimes fatal. But attacks against the human species are often a result of mistaken identity new research published on Tuesday shows.Thestudy published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface was conducted by looking at humans and animals from a great white shark's eye view below the ocean surface. It's often been assumed that it's hard for sharks to differentiate between them but there is little research taking into account how sharks see rather than just from their perspective from underwater.Sharks according to the research have limited color perception if they are not completely color blind and have spatial resolving power that is ""considerably worse than humans."" So when they are looking for prey researchers found they more heavily rely on motion and brightness contrast.To determine how great white sharks primarily juveniles since they are most often the ones involved in human interactions might see objects when looking up from below the ocean surface researchers specifically compared video footage of rectangular floats humans swimming humans paddling surfboards and pinnipeds including sea lions and seals. The footage was filtered to mimic the sharks' visual system.And as it turns out the researchers found that juvenile great whites cannot significantly differentiate between the different life forms. The silhouettes of the different objects at the surface are too similar for the animals given their reliance on motion and light.""From the perspective of a white shark...neither visual motion nor shape cues allow an unequivocal visual distinction between pinnipeds and humans"" the study says ""supporting the mistaken identity theory behind some bites.""Laura Ryan the lead author of the study said in apress releasefrom Macquarie University that surfers are the most at-risk for fatal shark bites particularly from juveniles.""We found that surfers swimmers and pinnipeds (seals and sea lions) on the surface of the ocean will look the same to a white shark looking up from below because these sharks can't see fine details or colours"" she said.Professor Nathan Hart senior author of the study said thatgreat whiteshave to learn what to eat and their diet changes as they grow and learn.

""It's a learning process that could be prone to mistakes.""The study was also conducted in a controlled pool setting rather than the ocean leading researchers to believe that the sharks' ability to differentiate between humans and prey is actually worse because of the lower visibility in oceans.

"Hundreds of world leaders powerful politicians billionaires celebrities religious leaders and drug dealers have been hiding their investments in mansions exclusive beachfront property yachts and other assets for the past quarter-century according to a review of nearly 12 million files obtained from 14 firms located around the world.The report released Sunday by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists involved 600 journalists from 150 media outlets in 117 countries. It's being dubbed the ""Pandora Papers"" because the findings shed light on the previously hidden dealings of the elite and the corrupt and how they have used offshore accounts to shield assets collectively worth trillions of dollars.The more than 330 current and former politicians identified as beneficiaries of the secret accounts include Jordan'sKing Abdullah II former U.K. Prime MinisterTony Blair Czech Republic Prime Minister Andrej Babis Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta Ecuador's President Guillermo Lasso and associates of both Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and Russian PresidentVladimir Putin.The billionaires called out in the report include Turkish construction mogul Erman Ilicak and Robert T. Brockman the former CEO of software maker Reynolds & Reynolds.Many of the accounts were designed to evade taxes and conceal assets for other shady reasons according to the report.""The new data leak must be a wake-up call"" said Sven Giegold a Green party lawmaker in the European Parliament. ""Global tax evasion fuels global inequality. We need to expand and sharpen the countermeasures now.""Oxfam International a British consortium of charities applauded the Pandora Papers for exposing brazen examples of greed that deprived countries of tax revenue that could be used to finance programs and projects for the greater good.""This is where our missing hospitals are"" Oxfam said in a statement. ""This is where the pay-packets sit of all the extra teachers and firefighters and public servants we need. Whenever a politician or business leader claims there is 'no money' to pay for climate damage and innovation for more and better jobs for a fair post-COVID recovery for more overseas aid they know where to look.""The Pandora Papers are a follow-up to a similar project released in 2016 called the ""Panama Papers"" compiled by the same journalistic group.The International Consortium of Investigative...02:15The latest bombshell is even more expansive porting through nearly 3 terabytes of data - the equivalent of roughly 750000 photos on a smartphone - leaked from 14 different service providers doing business in 38 different jurisdictions in the world. The records date back to the 1970s but most of the files span from 1996 to 2020.In contrast the Panama Papers culled through 2.6 terabytes of data leaked by one now-defunct law firm called Mossack Fonseca that was located in the country that inspired that project's nickname.The latest investigation dug into accounts registered in familiar offshore havens including the British Virgin Islands Seychelles Hong Kong and Belize. But some of the secret accounts were also scattered around in trusts set up in the U.S. including 81 in South Dakota and 37 in Florida.Some of the initial findings released Sunday painted a sordid picture of the prominent people involved.For instance the investigation found advisers helped King Abdullah II of Jordan set up at least three dozen shell companies from 1995 to 2017 helping the monarch buy 14 homes worth more than $106 million in the U.S. and the U.K. One was a $23 million California ocean-view property bought in 2017 through a British Virgin Islands company. The advisers were identified as an English accountant in Switzerland and lawyers in the British Virgin Islands.There was no immediate comment from Jordan's Royal Palace.The details are an embarrassing blow to Abdullah whose government was engulfed in scandal this year when his half brother former Crown Prince Hamzah accused the ""ruling system"" of corruption and incompetence. The kingclaimed he was the victim of a ""malicious plot""placed his half brother under house arrest and put two former close aides on trial.Jordan's prince reaffirms loyalty to King Abd...05:16U.K attorneys for Abdullah said he isn't required to pay taxes under his country's law and hasn't misused public funds adding that there are security and privacy reasons for him to have holdings through offshore companies according to the report. The attorneys also said most of the companies and properties are not connected to the king or no longer exist though they declined to provide details.Blair U.K. prime minister from 1997 to 2007 became the owner of an $8.8 million Victorian building in 2017 by buying a British Virgin Islands company that held the property and the building now hosts the law firm of his wife Cherie Blair according to the investigation. The two bought the company from the family of Bahrain's industry and tourism minister Zayed bin Rashid al-Zayani. Buying the company shares instead of the London building saved the Blairs more than $400000 in property taxes the investigation found.The Blairs and the al-Zayanis both said they didn't initially know the other party was involved in the deal the probe found. Cherie Blair said her husband wasn't involved in the purchase which she said was meant to bring ""the company and the building back into the U.K. tax and regulatory regime."" She also said she did not want to own a British Virgin Islands company and that the ""seller for their own purposes only wanted to sell the company"" which is now closed.A lawyer for the al-Zayanis said they complied with U.K. laws.Khan the Pakistani prime minister is not accused of any wrongdoing. But members of his inner circle including Finance Minister Shaukat Fayaz Ahmed Tarin are accused of hiding millions of dollars in wealth in secret companies or trusts according to the journalists' findings.In a tweet Khan vowed to recover the ""ill-gotten gains"" and said his government will look into all citizens mentioned in the documents and take action if needed.We welcome the Pandora Papers exposing the ill-gotten wealth of elites accumulated through tax evasion & corruption & laundered out to financial ""havens"".

"Stockholm— The Swedish artistLars Vilks who had lived under police protection since his 2007 sketch of the Prophet Muhammad with a dog's bodybrought death threats died from a traffic accident Sunday Swedish police confirmed to CBS News. The accident reportedly involved a truck colliding with a civilian police car in which Lars Vilks and his police protection were traveling according to local news outlets.Swedish police speaking to CBS News on Monday confirmed reports that Vilks 75 was killed in the crash while in police protective custody. Newspaper Dagens Nyheter said the artist's partner had also confirmed his death.The cause of the accident was under investigation.Vilks was largely unknown outside Sweden before his Muhammad drawing. At home he was best known for building a sculpture made of driftwood in a nature reserve in southern Sweden without permission triggering a lengthy legal battle. He was fined but the seaside sculpture — a jumble of wood nailed together in chaotic fashion — draws tens of thousands of visitors a year.Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks walks in the streets of Stockholm March 11 2010.Francois Campredon/AFP/GettyVilks' life changed radically 13 years ago after he drew a sketch of Muhammad with a dog's body. Dogs are considered unclean by conservative Muslims and Islamic law generally opposes any depiction of the prophet even favorable for fear it could lead to idolatry.Al Qaedaput a bounty on Vilks' head. In 2010 two mentried to burn down his housein southern Sweden. Last year a woman from Pennsylvania pleaded guilty in a plot to try to kill him.Bjorn Wiman the arts editor of the Dagens Nyheter paper called Vilks' death a ""complete shock of course. A tragedy.""""Lars Vilks has for over 10 years lived with constant threats to his life with bodyguards like a prisoner in his own home and has received death threats from one of the world's most dangerous terrorist organizations"" said Wiman. ""And then he dies in a traffic accident on a motorway in Smaland. Unbelievable.""""I think that Lars Vilks will go to history — and he would have anyway — but he will do it even more now as the early 2000s' most important Swedish artist"" Wiman told Swedish network TV4 adding: ""Hopefully the Swedish cultural establishment will learn something from this - that when people are threatened it's our task and duty to protect them.""Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical advicePablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";Cartoonist threatened over Prophet Muhammad drawing killed in crash;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lars-vilks-muhammad-drawing-death-threats-sweden-cartoonist-killed-car-crash/;mindset;0.930000
"North and South Korea restored their cross-border hotline on Monday a step Seoul said could help improve relations after Pyongyang sparked global concern with astring of missile tests in recent weeks.The two sides resumed communications with officials exchanging their first phone call since August days after the U.N. Security Council held an emergency meeting over the North Korea's latest missile tests.The two Koreas had signaled a surprise thaw in relations in late July by announcing the resumption of cross-border communications  severed more than a year earlier  but the detente was short-lived as Pyongyang stopped answering calls just two weeks later.Seoul's unification ministry confirmed the phone call on Monday morning between officials from the two rivals.""It's been a while and I'm very happy that the communication line has been restored"" a South Korean official told his northern counterpart in footage provided to reporters by the ministry.In a photo provided by the South Korean Defense Ministry an unidentified South Korean military officer makes a test call with a North Korean officer through an inter-Korean military communication line at an undisclosed location near the demilitarized zone in South Korea on Oct. 4 2021.South Korea Defense Ministry via APThe South's defense ministry also confirmed that cross-border military communications have resumed.""With the restoration of the South-North communication line the government evaluates that a foundation for recovering inter-Korean relations has been provided"" the unification ministry said in a statement.""The government hopes ... to swiftly resume dialogue and begin practical discussions for recovering inter-Korean relations.""Earlier on Monday North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had ""expressed the intention of restoring the cut-off north-south communication lines"" North Korea's official news agency KCNA said.It reported that the move was an attempt to establish ""lasting peace"" on the Korean peninsula.But an analyst played down Monday's restoration as a ""symbolic"" gesture noting the North's recent missile launches.""Even if this leads to talks we may enter a new phase where North Korea engages in dialogue but continues to carry out provocations simultaneously"" said Park Won-gon a professor of North Korean Studies at Ewha Womans University.North Korea had unilaterally cut off all official military and political communication links in June 2020 over activists sending anti-Pyongyang leaflets across the border.The two sides said on July 27 this year that all lines were restored.Their joint announcement which coincided with the anniversary of the end of the Korean War was the first positive development since a series of summits between Kim and the South Korean President Moon Jae-in in 2018 failed to achieve any significant breakthrough.They also revealed at the time that Kim and Moon had exchanged a series of letters since April in which they agreed that re-establishing hotlines would be a productive first step in rebooting relations between the two rivals which despite the end of their 1950-53 conflict remain technically at war.But the cross-border communication lasted for just two weeks with the North dropping them to protest joint US-South Korea military drills.In the period since Pyongyang has held a series of tension-raising missile tests.In September it launched what it said was a long-range cruise missile and earlier this week it tested what it described as a hypersonic gliding vehicle which South Korea's military said appeared to be in the early stages of development.On Friday it said it had successfully fired a new anti-aircraft missile.Pyongyang slammed the U.N.

"United Nations— The humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia's Tigray region ""is spiraling out of control"" according to the U.N. humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths with 5.2 million people in need of  food aid and 400000 living in famine-like conditions. The crisis is one that U.N. agencies and otherinternational aid organizationshave been trying to address for months.The U.N.'s World Food Program says malnutrition rates are 80% for pregnant and breastfeeding women in the region.Yet as widespread starvation looms the government of Ethiopiaannouncedit was expelling seven U.N. humanitarian workers ""for meddling in the internal affairs of the country."" It said it considered the  officials ""persona non grata"" an international lawtermusually applied to diplomats and ordered them to leave within the next 72 hours.The U.N. officials were from the children's agency (UNICEF) the U.N.'s human rights office (OHCHR) and five from the humanitarian aid agency (UNOCHA).U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres  said he was ""shocked"" by the expulsions adding that ""all U.N. humanitarian operations are guided by the core principles of humanity impartiality neutrality and independence.""""In Ethiopia the U.N. is delivering lifesaving aid — including food medicine water and sanitation supplies — to people in desperate need"" Guterres said.A woman carries an infant as she waits in line for food at the Tsehaye primary school which was turned into a temporary shelter for people displaced by conflict in the town of Shire Tigray region Ethiopia March 15 2021.BAZ RATNER / REUTERSHe added that the U.N. is ""engaging with the Government of Ethiopia in the expectation that the concerned U.N. staff will be allowed to continue their important work.""On Friday the U.N. secretary general's deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq said that the U.N. sent a formal communication called a ""Note Verbale"" to Ethiopia's mission to the U.N. ""to clarify that it is the long-standing legal position of the organizationnotto accept the application of the doctrine of 'persona non grata' with respect to United Nations officials."" In effect the legal move appeared designed to delay the expulsion in the hope of a possible reversal.Haq said Gueterres received a call Friday from Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ""in which the Secretary General reiterated the position of the United Nations."" He said Gueterres also sent a letter to the U.N. Security Council to inform them of the situation in Ethiopia and recent developments regarding U.N. staff.Six nations on the Security Council — the U.S. Ireland Estonia France Norway and the U.K. — immediately called for closed consultations on Friday.

"After a two-year delay and amid disapproval from more conservative parts of Japanese society the emperor's niece Princess Mako is finally set to marry her non-royal fiancé Kei Komuro this month. The pair who both turn 30 in October became college sweethearts after meeting at Tokyo's International Christian University in 2012. They announced their engagement in 2017 and said they intended to wed the following year but the nuptials were postponed following reports of a financial argument between Komuro's mother and her ex-fiancé.The reported dispute over whether about $36000 given to Komuro's mother by her own ex was a temporary loan or a permanent gift — some of which was apparently used to pay for Komuro's education — cast a distinctly common even scandalous light on Japan's staid imperial family.Japan's Princess Mako of Akishino attends the Men's singles final between Novak Djokovic of Serbia and John Millman of Australia on day seven of the Rakuten Open at the Ariake Coliseum October 6 2019 in Tokyo Japan.Koji Watanabe/GettyUnder Japan's centuries-old rules female imperial family members automatically forfeit their royal status upon marrying a commoner.Princess Mako's father Japan's Crown Prince Fumihito next in line toJapan's Chrysanthemum throne had publicly said that Komuro's family should settle the financial issue before his daughter's wedding could take place.Public sentiment then turned against Komuro and his engagement to Princess Mako as Japan's tabloid media seized on the story about his mother.Komuro flew back home from New York this week after graduating from Fordham University with a law degree. He was met at Tokyo's Narita airport by a throng of reporters.

"Commuters cross a road in Tokyo Japan as Typhoon Mindulle brings heavy rains and thousands of Japanese return to their work places for the first time in months following the lifting of the country's coronavirus state of emergency October 1 2021.Kiichiro Sato/APTokyo— Japan has fully dropped itscoronavirusstate of emergency for the first time in more than six months as the country starts to gradually ease anti-virus measures to help rejuvenate the pandemic-hit economy as the infections slowed. At Tokyo's busy Shinagawa train station a sea of mask-wearing commuters rushed to work despite an approaching typhoon with some returning to their offices for the first time after months of remote work.The emergency measures in place for more than half of the country including Tokyo ended on Thursday following a steady fall in new caseloads over the past few weeks helping to easepressure on Japanese health caresystems.Outgoing Prime MinisterYoshihide Suga thanked the people for their patience and cooperation and asked them to stick to their basic anti-virus measures.""Once again I seek your cooperation so that we can return to our daily lives feeling safe"" he said.Olympics are coming to an end as COVID surges...06:35The lifting of the emergency marked a fresh start for some people.Office worker Akifumi Sugihara 46 said he is back to the train station for the first time in about a year. ""I had been working from home for more than a year and I came to the office in Tokyo as (the emergency) was lifted today"" he said. ""It's really been a while. I feel it's a new start.""Another office worker Kaori Hayashi 37 said it was an ordinary Friday. ""In my mind nothing really has changed"" she said. ""We still need to be careful. I will stay vigilant and carry on my life as usual.""Japan is eager to expand social and economic activities while balancing the need to prevent another wave of infections as the weather turns cooler. Officials say the government still needs time to create more temporary COVID-19 treatment facilities and continuevaccinationsto prepare for any future resurgence.The emergency measures have mainly involved requests for eateries to curb alcohol and hours.

"More than 395000 acres from four of Australia's national parks was returned to the Aboriginal Eastern Kuku Yalanji people in a ""historic"" agreement officialsannouncedWednesday.Among the land is tourist hotspotDaintree National Park a roughly 2.2-million-acre rainforest that's part of Australia's Wet Tropics which is aUNESCO World Heritage site. The rainforest which lies on Queensland's northeast coast bordering the Coral Sea is believed to be one of the oldest rainforests in the world and the original home of the Kuku Yalanji.The agreement also includes the Ngalba-bulal Kalkajak and Hope Islands National Parks and will create a new nature refuge.All of these lands according to the Minister for Environment and the Great Barrier Reef's office will now be jointly managed by both the Queensland Government and the Eastern Kuku Yalanji people. The group will receive annual funds from the country to help manage the sites.Eastern Kuku Yalanji woman Chrissy Grant who has been working for four years to negotiate the agreement with Eastern Kuku Yalanji said in a statement that the goal of the announcement is to ""establish a foundation"" to help tribe members be ""in control of our own destinies."" Her goal is to eventually create an arrangement where the Indigenous group solely manages the area.""On 29 September 2021 this significant historic event becomes legal and a reality for the Eastern Kuku Yalanji Bama to realize our vision for a more promising future for all our people"" she said.The Daintree Rainforest is 180 million years old according to the Queensland Australiatourism site— older than the Amazon. The forest is part of the Wet Tropics which was added to the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization's World Heritage Site list in 1988 for its ""extremely important"" biodiversity the tourism site says. The forest is home to hundreds of species of mammals birds and reptiles as well as thousands of species of plants.The Kuku Yalanji has held the title over much of the land since2007. Under the title the Kuku Yalanji own roughly 14400 hectares of land including tropical rainforests beaches reefs and mountains. Full time rangers are employed by the country as part of the agreement to help manage fires vegetation walking and vehicle tracks camps and activities patrols and the land and sea itself among other things.The Kuku Yalanji are some of the earliest humans to live in Australia making their home in the Daintree forest with a history dating back 50000 years according toAustralia's Mossman Gorge Centre.Aboriginal peoples have continuously lived in the Daintree and other areas of the Wet Tropics for at least 5000 years according to thegovernment and the area is the only place Aboriginal people have permanently inhabited a tropical rainforest.Environment Minister Meaghan Scanlon said the agreement is a step towards reconciliation with the country's Aboriginal people and deal with Australia's uncomfortable and ugly past.""The Eastern Kuku Yalanji people's culture is one of the world's oldest living cultures and this agreement recognizes their right to own and manage their Country to protect their culture and to share it with visitors as they become leaders in the tourism industry"" she said. ""These national parks will protect important Aboriginal cultural sites diverse ecosystems including rainforests woodlands wetlands and mangroves and form part of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area which is recognized as the second most irreplaceable world heritage site on Earth.""The move is just the latest in Australia's efforts to give land back to its original Indigenous owners.In 1976 the country passed legislation authorizing Australia's government to purchase privately owned land to give back to Indigenous communities. Since thenroughly 50%of Indigenous land in the country's Northern Territory has been returned to its Aboriginal owners according to the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies.Legislation passed in 1993 authorized Australian governments to give land back to its Indigenous owners. To get land titles Indigenous groups must have preserved traditional laws and customs have a ""connection"" to the land in question and have rights and interests recognized by Australian law according to theQueensland government.So far Scanlon said the country has returned more than 3.8 million hectares — more 9390000 acres — of land. More than 5683423 acres of that land is jointly managed with the country's park rangers. On the Cape York Peninsula alone where Daintree is located she said there are 32 Aboriginal-owned and jointly-managed national parks.Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical advicePablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsLi CohenLi Cohen is a social media producer and trending reporter for CBS News focusing on social justice issues.";Ancient Australian rainforest returned to Aboriginal owners;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/eastern-kuku-yalanji-daintree-national-park-australia/;mindset;0.930000

""They've destroyed everything."" She then asked her 8-year-old son about the incident. ""Milan tell the truth. Say how your mummy stood up to the wild boar"" she said according to the BBC.A wild boar walks through the Les Conserves neighborhood in Molins de Rei an area close to the mountain of the Collserola Natural Park in Spain April 28 2020.Joan Gosa/Xinhua via Getty) (Xinhua/ via Getty ImagesWhile the incident seems bizarre Shakira is just one victim in a string of attacks by wild boars in Barcelona.In 2016 police in Spain received 1187 calls about hogs attacking dogs running into cars and holding up traffic. And the problem made headlines in 2013 when a police officer attempted to shoot a wild boar but missed and accidentally hit his partner BBC News reports.The number of boars has exploded across Europe – not just in Spain – with more than 10 million across the continent. Not only can they be aggressive but they can carry disease — and they can survive in almost any environment including cities where they can feed off garbage.In Italy last year a police officer killed a family of wild boars in a playground with a tranquilizer dart and lethal injections which sparked outrage BBC News reports.Wild boars eat garbages near trash bins in Rome Friday Sept. 24 2021. They have become a daily sight in Rome families of wild boars trotting down the city streets sticking their snouts in the garbage looking for food.Gregorio Borgia / APVideosfrom Romelast week show groups ofwild boars rampagingthe city and eating garbage.The ongoing boar issue has even spilled over into Rome's mayoral race with Mayor Virginia Raggi who is seeking re-election filing a legal suit earlier this month accusing the Lazio region of failing to keep the animals out of the capitalaccording to Reuters.The region denied her accusations saying management of the animals around Rome is up to the city's councils.""Even walking to school...has become dangerous here"" Nunzia Cammino who lives in Rome told Reuters.And as wild boars wandering into Germany from Poland spread African swine fever Germany last week asked the European Commission to help them put up a fence to counter the spread.

Officials said at least five of the dead were found to have been beheaded.President Guillermo Lasso decreed a state of emergency Wednesday which will give the government powers that include deploying police and soldiers inside prisons. The order came a day after bloodshed at the Litoral penitentiary in Guayaquil that officials blamed on gangs linked to international drug cartels fighting for control of the facility.Lasso visibly moved by the carnage said at a news conference that what had happened in the prison was ""bad and sad."" He also said he could not guarantee that authorities had regained control of the lockup.""It is regrettable that the prisons are being turned into territories for power disputes by criminal gangs"" he said adding that he would act with ""absolute firmness"" to regain control of the Litoral prison and prevent the violence from spreading to other penitentiaries.Images circulating on social media showed dozens of bodies in the prison's Pavilions 9 and 10 and scenes that looked like battlefields. The fighting was with firearms knives and bombs officials said. Earlier regional police commander Fausto Buenaño had said that bodies were being found in the prison's pipelines.Outside the prison morgue the relatives of inmates wept with some describing to reporters the cruelty with which their loved ones were killed decapitated and dismembered.A woman cries outside the Litorial Penitentiary while waiting for information from her relative on September 29 2021 in Guayaquil Ecuador.

Mario Pazmiño the former director of Ecuador's military intelligence said the bloody fighting shows that ""transnational organized crime has permeated the structure"" of Ecuador's prisons adding that Mexico's Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels operate through local gangs.""They want to sow fear"" he told The Associated Press on Wednesday urging the government to temporarily cede control of the prisons to the National Police. ""The more radical and violent the way they murder"" the more they achieve their goal of control he added.Members of the Ecuadorian Army stand guard outside a prison in Guayaquil Ecuador September 29 2021 after a deadly riot.FERNANDO MENDEZ/AFP via GettyEcuador's president said that care points had been set up for relatives of the inmates with food and psychological support. He added that a $24 million program to address the country's prisons will be accelerated starting with investments in infrastructure and technology in the Litoral prison.The former director of Ecuador's prison bureau Fausto Cobo said that inside penitentiaries authorities face a ""threat with power equal to or greater than the state itself."" He said that while security forces must enter prisons with shields and unarmed they are met by inmates with high-caliber weapons.In July the president decreed another state of emergency in Ecuador's prison system following several violent episodes that resulted in more than 100 inmates being killed. Those deaths occurred in various prisons and not in a single facility like Tuesday's massacre.Previously the bloodiest day occurred in February when 79 prisoners died in simultaneous riots in three prisons in the country. In July 22 more prisoners lost their lives in the Litoral penitentiary while in September a penitentiary center was attacked by drones leaving no fatalities.Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical advicePablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";Ecuador declares prison emergency after 116 killed in riot;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ecuador-prison-riots-2021-state-of-emergency-deaths-beheadings/;mindset;0.930000

The sentence — the maximum in the U.K. where there is no death penalty — was handed down by a court after two days of hearings where prosecutors argued that Wayne Couzens hadfalsely arrestedEverard before raping and killing her.""In my judgement the misuse of a police officer's role such as occurred in this case in order to kidnap rape and murder a lone victim is of equal seriousness as a murder carried out for the purpose of advancing a political religious racial or ideological cause"" Justice Adrian Fulford said. ""All of these situations attack different aspects of the fundamental underpinning of our democratic way of life.""Everard a 33-year-old marketing executive was abducted from a London street in early March while walking home from dinner at a friend's house.

"Scientists have discovered two new species of large predatory dinosaurs with ""unusual crocodile-like skulls"" on England's Isle of Wight. The dinosaurs are believed to be species of spinosaurids and are the first skeletons of the dinosaur family to be uncovered in the United Kingdom since 1983.The two new species are related to an ancient ""unusual and controversial"" family of dinosaurs according to a report by paleontologists at the University of Southampton that was published inScientific Reportson Wednesday.The first Ceratosuchops inferodios which means ""horned crocodile-faced hell heron"" has a head filled with low horns and bumps along its brow regionscientists found and is believed to have had a hunting style similar to a ""terrifying heron.""The second discovery Riparovenator milnerae which means ""Milner's riverbank hunter"" is similar to that of the Ceratosuchops inferodios and has a long tail and a crocodile-like snout. It was named in honor of British paleontologist Angela Milner who died on August 13. Milner is credited with naming the new species' closest relative the Baryonyx dinosaur.Artists' impression of newly identified species.Anthony Hutchings/University of SouthamptonThe skeletons are still incomplete but based on the tail and cranial fossils found so far researchers believe both dinosaurs were about nine meters long — more than 29 feet. Their skulls were roughly a meter long — more than 3 feet.Study co-author David Horne said it's ""very common"" for ""similar and closely related"" carnivores to have lived in the same ecosystem.""The Early Cretaceous rocks on the Isle of Wight describe an ancient floodplain environment bathed in a Mediterranean-like climate. Whilst generally balmy forest fires occasionally ravaged the landscape and the remains of burnt wood can be seen throughout the cliffs today"" the University of Southampton said in a press release. ""With a large river and other bodies of water attracting dinosaurs and housing various fish sharks and crocodiles the habitat provided the newly discovered spinosaurids with plenty of hunting opportunities.""The new dinosaurs are believed to be from the Cretaceous period with the bones estimated to be more than 125 million years old scientists said in a press release. Their research suggests spinosaurids may have first evolved in Europe before migrating to Asia Africa and South America.Isle of Wight is commonly known as ""Dinosaur Island"" as fossils can be easily found along its beaches.Discovered brain case of the Ceratosuchops inferodios which translates as the ""horned crocodile-faced hell heron.""Chris Barker/University of SouthamptonIn fact it was a simple discovery on these beaches by two fossil collectors that ignited the hunt to identify the new species. In 2013 the University of Southampton said fossil collectors found parts of two skulls near the isle's Brighstone Beach. Soon after members of Dinosaur Isle Museum found a large portion of a tail and now more than 50 bones have been found scientists said.""This is the rarest and most exciting find I've made in over 30 years of fossil collection"" Brian Foster one of the collectors said in a statement.Jeremy Lockwood who also found some of the fossils said ""We realized after the two snouts were found that this would be something rare and unusual. Then it just got more and more amazing as several collectors found and donated other parts of this enormous jigsaw to the museum.""But scientists have long had a hunch that there were other spinosaur species out there.""We've known for a couple of decades now that Bryonyx-like dinosaurs awaited discovered on the Isle of Wight"" said study co-author Darren Naish in a statement ""but finding the remains of two such animals in close succession was a huge surprise.""The last and only time a spinosaurid skeleton had been uncovered in the U.K. researchers said was in 1983. Aside from that skeleton which was deemed to be that of a Baryonyx researchers have only come across isolated teeth.Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesPablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical adviceGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsLi CohenLi Cohen is a social media producer and trending reporter for CBS News focusing on social justice issues.";"Scientists discover ""horned crocodile-faced hell heron"" dinosaur";https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dinosaur-horned-crocodile-faced-hell-heron-scientists-bones/;mindset;0.930000
"A Danish artist was given $84000 by a museum to use in a work of art. When he delivered the piece he was supposed to make it was not as promised. Instead the artist Jens Haaning gave the Kunsten Museum of Modern Art in Aalborg Denmark two blank canvases and said they were titled ""Take the Money and Run.""Haaning was asked to recreate two of his previous works: 2010's ""An Average Danish Annual Income"" and ""An Average Austrian Annual Income"" first exhibited in 2007. Both used actual cash to show the average incomes of the two countries according to a news release from the artist.In addition to compensation for the work Haaning was also give bank notes to use in the work museum director Lasse Andersson told CBS News via email. Their contract even stated the museum would give Haaning an additional 6000 euros to update the work if needed Andersson said. At the time the works were initially exhibited the Danish piece highlighted the average income of 328000 kroner approximately $37800 while the average Austrian salary illustrated was around €25000 or $29000.For the ""Work it Out"" exhibit at the Kunsten Museum of Modern Art Haaning was meant to fill frames with money. But they were empty.Jens Haaning""We also have a contract that the money $84000 US dollars to be displayed in the work is not Jens' and that it must be paid back when the exhibition closes on 16 January 2022"" Andersson said.""The exhibition is called 'Work it Out' and features works of art by many different contemporary artists"" he said adding that the exhibition It runs from September 24 to January 16 2022.Andersson said when they spoke to the artist about making the piece earlier this year he agreed to the contract and ""he indicated a fairly easy job.""But when it came time for Haaning to actually deliver he did the unexpected.""The curator received an email in which Jens Haaning wrote that he had made a new piece of art work and changed the work title into 'Take the Money and Run'"" Andersson said. ""Subsequently we could ascertain that the money had not been put into the work.""Indeed the frames meant to be filled withcashwere empty.""The staff was very surprised when they opened the crates. I was abroad when the crates were opened but suddenly received a lot of mails"" Andersson said.When he finally saw ""Take the Money and Run"" Andersson said he actually laughed. ""Jens is known for his conceptual and activistic art with a humoristic touch. And he gave us that – but also a bit of a wake up call as everyone know wonders were did the money go"" he said.According to Haaning's press release ""the idea behind was to show how salaries can be used to measure the value of work and to show national differences within the European Union. But by changing the title of the work to ""Take the Money and Run"" Haaning ""questions artists' rights and their working conditions in order to establish more equitable norms within the art industry.""""Everyone would like to have more money and in our society work industries are valued differently"" Haaning said in a statement. ""The artwork is essentially about the working conditions of artists. It is a statement saying that we also have the responsibility of questioning the structures that we are part of. And if these structures are completely unreasonable we must break with them. It can be your marriage your work - it can be any type of societal structure"".Andersson said while it wasn't what they had agreed on in the contract the museum got new and interesting art. ""When it comes to the amount of $84000 he hasn't broke any contract yet as the initial contract says we will have the money back on January 16th 2022.""The museum director said they'll wait and see what Haaning does but if the money is not returned on January 16 ""we will of course take the necessary steps to ensure that Jens Haaning complies with his contract.""He said they are in contact with Haaning who he called a ""well-respected and well-known artist in Denmark.""

"Former President of France Nicolas Sarkozy participates in a roundtable discussion during the National Convention of Spain's PP political party September 29 2021 in Madrid Spain.Gustavo Valiente/Europa Press News/GettyParis— Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was found guilty on Thursday of illegal campaign financing during his unsuccessful 2012 reelection bid. The court handed him a one-year sentence but said the 66-year-old former president could serve it from home with electronic monitoring.Sarkozy wasn't present at the Paris court for the announcement of the verdict and sentence but his lawyer quickly said that he would appeal the ruling.He is accused of having spent almost twice the maximum legal amount of 22.5 million euros ($27.5 million) on the reelection bid that he lost to Socialist Francois Hollande.The court stated that Sarkozy ""knew"" the legal limit was at stake and ""voluntarily"" failed to supervise additional expenses.Prosecutors had requested a six-month prison term for the campaign finance charges as well as a six-month suspended sentence and a fine of 3750 euros ($4354).Sarkozy France's president from 2007 to 2012 has vigorously denied all wrongdoing. \The verdict handed down on Thursday came seven months afterSarkozy was convictedin a separate corruption and influence peddling case.2007: French President Nicolas Sarkozy13:28Sarkozy was found guilty on March 1 of those charges and was given one year in prison and two years suspended sentence but has remained free pending an appeal on those charges.If his appeals of both court rulings are eventually rejected Sarkozy would face a total four-year sentence and would have to serve three of them in prison.In the campaign financing case prosecutors concluded that Sarkozy knew weeks before the 2012 election that his expenses — which are strictly limited under French law — were getting close to the legal maximum. They accused him of having ignored two notes from his accountants warning about the money issue.Prosecutors argued Sarkozy is ""the only person responsible for his campaign financing"" and that he chose to exceed the limit by organizing many rallies including giant ones.During his hearing Sarkozy told the court the extra money did not go into his campaign but instead helped make other people richer. He denied any ""fraudulent intent."" He also insisted he did not handle day-to-day organization because he had a team to do that and therefore could not be blamed for the amount of spending.In addition to the former president 13 other people went on trial including members of his conservative Republicans party accountants and heads of the communication group in charge of organizing the rallies Bygmalion. They face charges including forgery breach of trust fraud and complicity in illegal campaign financing.Some have acknowledged wrongdoing and detailed the system of false invoices that aimed to cover up the overspending.Prosecutors have requested mostly suspended prison sentences and up to one year in prison for Bygmalion's co-founder.Sarkozy retired from active politics in 2017 but is still playing a role behind the scenes. French media have reported that he is involved in the process of choosing a conservative candidate ahead of France's presidential election next year.Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesPablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical adviceGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";Ex-president Sarkozy guilty of breaking French campaign finance laws;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nicolas-sarkozy-france-ex-president-guilty-breaking-campaign-finance-laws/;mindset;0.930000

Wayne Couzens haspleaded guiltyto kidnapping raping and murdering the 33-year-old marketing executive and is due to be sentenced on Thursday.""His movements were consistent with the defendant looking for or hunting for a lone young female to kidnap and rape which is precisely what he did"" Little said.The prosecution argued that Couzens who was off duty at the time he detained Everard was likely wearing his police belt and that he showed her his police warrant card in order to detain her. The prosecution argued Everard was vulnerable to his plot because she had gone to dinner at a friend's house despite lockdown rules in place at the time which were often enforced by police.After detaining her Couzens forced Everard into a rental car.

However South Korean officials said the North still appeared to be a ""considerable time"" from finalizing the new weapon and that defense systems shared with the U.S. were capable of stopping it.The launch from Jagang province ""confirmed the navigational control and stability of the missile"" along with its ""guiding maneuverability and the gliding flight characteristics of the detached hypersonic gliding warhead"" and the engine according to KCNA which called it the Hwasong-8.The newly developed hypersonic missile Hwasong-8 is test-fired by the Academy of Defense Science of the DPRK [North Korea] in Toyang-ri Ryongrim County of Jagang Province North Korea in an undated photo released on September 29 2021 by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).KCNA via REUTERSThe launch was watched by top official Pak Jong Chon it said but there was no indication that leader Kim Jong Un witnessed it.The official Rodong Sinmun newspaper carried a picture of the weapon — with a set of guidance fins at the base of its nose cone — ascending into the morning sky.The South Korean military had announced the launch shortly after it happened on Tuesday but it did not reveal the missile's maximum altitude and flight distance afterwards information it normally makes available within around an hour.On Wednesday Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the South Korean and U.S. militaries were ""capable of detecting and intercepting it.""""Based on an assessment of its characteristics such as speed it is at an initial phase of development and will take a considerable time to be deployed"" they said in a statement.U.S. condemns North Korea missile test01:23Both Koreas are building up their weapons capabilities in what could become an arms race on the divided peninsula with ramifications for neighboring Japan China and the wider region.The nuclear-armed North which invaded the South in 1950 is under multiple sets of international sanctions over its banned nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs and earlier this month said it hadtested a long-range cruise missile.Developing the hypersonic missile was one of five ""top priority"" tasks in the five-year plan for strategic weapons KCNA said.Since inheriting power following the death of his father nearly 10 years ago Kim has overseen rapid improvements inthe North Korean arsenal including developing intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that can reach the whole of the continental United States and its most powerful nuclear test to date.North Korea leader Kim Jong Un at paramilitary parade held to mark the 73rd founding anniversary of the republic at Kim Il Sung Square in Pyongyang in undated image supplied by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency on September 9 2021.KCNA via REUTERSIn January Kim offered a shopping list of goals that as well as hypersonic warheads also included a nuclear-powered submarine military reconnaissance satellites and solid-fuel ICBMs at a five-yearly congress of the ruling Workers' Party — a meeting at which he described the United States as his country's ""principal enemy.""Lim Eul-chul a professor at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies at Kyungnam University said North Korea was looking to use its weapons development ""as a means to make room for diplomatic maneuvering as well as enhancing military posture"".More launches could be expected in the future he added: ""In a way the North's recent behavior is very predictable. They had signaled military actions and are now executing them step by step.""Rising tension as both sides arm-upSeoul is also spending billions on military development and this month successfullytest-fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile(SLBM) for the first time making it one of a handful of nations with the advanced technology.On Tuesday it held a ceremony to launch its third submarine capable of carrying SLBMs.Washington and Seoul are security allies and the United States stations around 28500 troops in the South to protect it from its neighbor.Activity seen at North Korea nuclear reactor00:35Talks between Pyongyang and Washington have been largely at a standstill since a 2019 summit in Hanoi between leader Kim and then-president Donald Trumpcollapsedover sanctions relief and what North Korea would be willing to give up in return.Since then Pyongyang has repeatedly excoriated the South and its president Moon and blown up a liaison office on its side of the border that Seoul had built although in recent days leader Kim's influential sister Kim Yo Jong has dangled the prospect of an inter-Korean summit.The administration of President Joe Biden - which condemned Tuesday's launch as a sanctions violation and a threat to the international community - has repeatedly said it is willing to meet North Korean officials anywhere at any time without preconditions in its efforts to seek denuclearization.But North Korea has not shown any willingness to give up its arsenal which it says it needs to defend itself against a U.S. invasion.North KoreaMoreSouth Korea has partial success with 1st launch into the space raceNorth Korea confirms test of missile designed for submarine launchN.

"Former Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida attends a press conference at the Liberal Democratic Party (LPD) headquarters after he was elected as the party president in Tokyo Japan September 29 2021.Du Xiaoyi/Pool via REUTERSTokyo— Japan's former Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida won the governing party leadership election on Wednesday and is set to become the next prime minister. He faces the imminent tasks of addressing a pandemic-hit economy and ensuring a strong alliance with Washington to counter growing regional security risks.Kishida replaces outgoing party leader Prime MinisterYoshihide Suga who is stepping down after serving only one year since taking office last September.As new leader of the Liberal Democratic Party Kishida is certain to be elected the next prime minister on Monday in parliament where his party and its coalition partner control both houses.In his victory speech Kishida vowed to tackle Japan's ""national crises"" includingCOVID-19 the economy battered by the pandemic and thedeclining population and birthrate while pursuing ""important issues related to Japan's future"" through a vision of ""a free and open Indo-Pacific"" that countersChina's assertivenessin the region.Replacing Humans: Robots Among Us35:16Kishida beat popular vaccinations minister Taro Kono in a runoff after finishing only one vote ahead of him in the first round where none of the four candidates including two women was able to win a majority.His 257-170 landslide win in the second round showed a consensus-building Kishida garnered more support from party heavyweights who apparently chose stability over change advocated by Kono who is known as something of a maverick and a reformist.The new leader is under pressure to change the party's high-handed reputation worsened by Suga who angered the public over his handling of the pandemic and insistence on holding the Summer Olympics in Tokyo despite the surging infections.The long-ruling conservative Liberal Democratic Party desperately needs to quickly turn around plunging public support ahead of lower house elections coming within two months.During the past year Kishida said he heard from many voters complaining they were being ignored. ""I felt our democracy is in a crisis"" he said in his speech. ""I Fumio Kishida have a special skill of listening to people. I am determined to make an effort toward making a more open LDP and a bright future for Japan together with you all.""The 64-year-old former foreign minister was once seen as an indecisive moderate. Lately however he has shifted to a security and diplomatic hawk as he sought support from influential conservatives to win the party election.Kishida has called for a further increase in Japan's defense capability and budget and vowed to stand up to China intensions over self-ruled Taiwanthat China claims as part of its territory and Beijing's crackdown on dissent inHong Kong.Pro-democracy leaders arrested in Hong Kong02:14On the economy Kishida has called for a ""new capitalism"" of growth and distribution to narrow income gaps between the rich and the poor that have widened under Japan's longest-serving former leader Shinzo Abe and only worsened during the pandemic.He also pledged to promote clean energy technology to turn climate change measures into growth and proposed a generous economic recovery package.Overall little change is expected in key diplomatic and security policies under the new leader said Yu Uchiyama a political science professor at the University of Tokyo.Kishida also supports close Japan-U.S. security ties and partnerships with other like-minded democracies in Asia and Europe in part to counter China and nuclear-armed North Korea.Wednesday's vote was seen as a test of whether the party can move out of Abe's shadow. His influence in government and party affairs has largely muzzled diverse views and shifted the party to the right.Kishida has called for party reforms by limiting terms for executive positions but is seen as a choice who could prolong an era of unusual political stability amid fears that Japan could return to ""revolving door"" leadership.""Concern is not about individuals but stability of Japanese politics"" Michael Green senior vice president for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies told a telephone briefing ahead of the vote. ""It's about whether or not we are entering a period in Japanese politics of instability and short-term prime ministership"" he said. ""It makes it very hard to move forward on agenda.""Green said voters will be watching if Kishida is easily swayed by power politics in his party or if he is attuned to the public.Suga is leaving only a year after taking office as a pinch hitter for Abe who suddenly resigned over health problems ending his nearly eight-year leadership the longest in Japan's constitutional history.Kishida lost to Suga in the 2020 party leadership race which was a done deal determined by party heavyweights even before the vote. A third-generation politician from Hiroshima Kishida has a reputation among his fellow lawmakers as polite and honest.He was first elected to parliament in 1993. An advocate for nuclear disarmament he escorted former President Barack Obama during his 2016 visit to Hiroshima the city that was obliterated together with Nagasaki in the U.S. atomic bombings in the closing days of World War II.As foreign minister under Abe he struck a 2015 agreement with South Korea to resolve a bilateral row over the issue of World War II women who were sexually abused by Japan's wartime military - part of legacy that still hampers relations between the two countries.The banker-turned-lawmaker enjoys drinking sake and is a staunch supporter of his hometown professional baseball team Hiroshima Carp.Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesPablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical adviceSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";Former top diplomat chosen by party to lead Japan as next PM;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fumio-kishida-japan-next-prime-minister-election-by-party/;mindset;0.930000
"Los Llanos de Aridane Canary Islands —Lava from avolcano on Spain's Canary Islandshas reached the sea after 10 days of wiping out hundreds of homes and causing the evacuation of thousands of residents. Columns of steam that experts had warned could contain toxic gases shot upward when the bright red molten rock tumbled into the Atlantic Ocean at 11 p.m. on Tuesday.The area had been evacuated for several days as authorities waited for the lava to reach the water. Its erratic flows and changes in the terrain had slowed its progress. Authorities established a security perimeter of about 2 miles and asked residents in the wider area to remain indoors with windows shut to avoid breathing in gases.Lava from the Cumbre Vieja volcano hits the ocean at Los Girres beach in Tazacorte on the Canary island of La Palma Spain early on September 29 2021.SUNSETS SWEDEN/AFP via GettyLava flows from the September 19 eruption of La Palma's Cumbre Vieja volcano have destroyed at least 589 buildings mostly homes on the island's southwestern side that were caught on a slope below the volcano.No deaths or serious injuries have been reported thanks to the prompt evacuations of over 6000 people in the first hours after last week's eruption.La Palma home to about 85000 people is part of the volcanic Canary Islands an archipelago off northwest Africa.

"Anew studyreleased Tuesday from the University of California San Francisco and the University of Washington found air pollution likely caused millions of babies to be born prematurely and under a healthy weight in 2019. Babies who are born with low birth weights or born prematurely have significant health disadvantages including higher rates of major illnesses throughout their lives.The World Health Organization has estimated that approximately 90% of the global population lives with outdoor air pollution and 50% of the global populations also lives with indoor air pollution from wood coal and dung-fueled fires inside the home.The study looked at how air pollution affected multiple parts of pregnancy including length of pregnancy birth weight preterm birth and weight loss after birth. It's the first study to include indoor air pollution which accounted for two thirds of the documented effects.In 2019 air pollution resulted in nearly 6 million premature births and 3 million underweight babies worldwide according to the study. And in the United States ambient air pollution contributed to an estimated 12000 premature births.Meanwhile in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa premature births and low birth weights could be reduced by 78% if air pollution was reduced the study found. The two geographic areas have both common indoor air pollution due to indoor cook-fires and some of the highest premature birth rates in the world.""The air pollution-attributable burden is enormous yet with sufficient effort it could be largely mitigated""saidlead author Rakesh Ghosh in a press release. Ghosh is a a prevention and public health specialist at the Institute for Global Health Sciences at UCSF.In aprevious study the same team found that air pollution directly contributed to the deaths of 500000 newborns in 2019.""With this new global and more rigorously generated evidence air pollution should now be considered a major driver of infant morbidity and mortality not just of chronic adult diseases"" Ghosh said. ""Our study suggests that taking measures to mitigate climate change and reduce air pollution levels will have significant health co-benefit for newborns.""Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical advicePablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";Air pollution linked to nearly 6 million premature births in 2019;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/air-pollution-premature-birth-underweight-babies/;mindset;0.930000
"London— A shortage of truck drivers in Britain has led to a national fuel crisis that is causing long lines at gas stations across the country with many pumps running dry.""As soon as a tanker arrives at a filling station people on social media are advising that a tanker has arrived and then it is like bees to a honey pot"" Brian Madderson chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association told Britain's Times Newspaper.""Everyone flocks there and . . . within a few hours it is out again"" he said.The government put part of the blame for fuel crisis on panic buying. Britain's Transport Secretary Grant Shapps urged people not to purchase more fuel than they usually would amid reports of some filling up water bottles at their local gas stations. And there were reports of fights breaking out at some pumps with one video on social media showing a man waiting on line for gas brandishing a knife.""The sooner we can all return to our normal buying habits the sooner the situation will return to normal"" Shapps told Sky News.Brexit trucks and fuelA big reason for the crisis is a shortage of truck drivers.When the U.K. left the European Union it became harder for many foreign workers including truck drivers to work in Britain.

"Beijing— A pair of American siblings who were trapped for three years in China have returned home after Beijing lifted a so-called ""exit ban"" following Canada'srelease of a top Chinese tech executivewanted in the U.S. on fraud charges. A State Department spokesperson saidCynthia and Victor Liureturned to the U.S. on Sunday after consular staff in Shanghai helped facilitate their departure.A pair of Canadians held in China werealso permitted to leaveafter Canada released Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on Friday.The State Department spokesperson quoted on routine condition of anonymity in an undated statement added that the U.S. opposes the use of ""coercive exit bans against people who are not themselves charged with crimes"" and would continue to ""advocate on behalf of all American citizens in (China) subject to arbitrary detention and coercive exit bans.""It was never clear why China had imposed an exit ban on the American siblings and there case was never explicitly linked by Beijing to the detention of Meng in Canada.The Lius traveled to China in 2018 to pay respects to their dying grandmother but then found authorities blocking their departure at every border point.Their estranged father Liu Changming is one of China's most wanted fugitives. Liu who fled the country in 2007 is the former executive of a state-owned bank and is linked to a $1.4 billion fraud case.

"North Korea fired a short-range missile into the sea early Tuesday its neighboring countries said in the latest weapon tests by North Korea.In an emergency National Security Council meeting the South Korean government expressed regret over what it called ""a short-range missile launch"" by the North. South Korea's military earlier said the object fired from North Korea's mountainous northern Jagang province flew toward the waters off the North's eastern coast.The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said in a statement the launch doesn't pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel or territory or to our allies. But it said the missile launch ""highlights the destabilizing impact of (North Korea's) illicit weapons program"" and that the U.S. commitment to the defense of South Korea and Japan ""remains ironclad.""Details of the launch were being analyzed by South Korean and U.S. authorities. But Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said North Korea fired ""what could be a ballistic missile"" and that his government stepped up its vigilance and surveillance.A ballistic missile launch would violate a U.N. Security Council ban on North Korean ballistic activities but the council typically doesn't impose new sanctions on North Korea for launches of short-range weapons.Tests of ballistic and cruise missiles earlier this month were North Korea's first such launches in six months and displayed its ability to attack targets in South Korea and Japan both key U.S. allies where a total of 80000 American troops are stationed.But last Friday and Saturday Kim Yo Jong the influential sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reached out to Seoul saying her country was open to resuming talks and reconciliatory steps if conditions are met. Some experts said North Korea wants South Korea to work to win it relief from U.S.-led sanctions.South Korea has called her statement ""meaningful"" but urged North Korea to restore communication channels before any talks between the rivals can be arranged.The communication lines have remained largely dormant for about 15 months so restoring them could be a yardstick to asses how serious the North is about its offer for conditional talks. Seoul's Unification Ministry said Tuesday North Korea remains unresponsive to South Korea's attempts to exchange messages over the channels.As the North's missile launch was detected by its rivals on Tuesday the third round of such tests this month North Korean Ambassador Kim Song used his speech on the last day of the U.N. General Assembly to justify his country's development of a ""war deterrent"" to defend against U.S. threats.""The possible outbreak of a new war on the Korean Peninsula is contained not because of the U.S.'s mercy on the DPRK it is because our state is growing a reliable deterrent that can control the hostile forces in an attempted military invasion"" Kim said. DPRK refers to Democratic People's Republic of Korea North Korea's official name.The North's latest outreach came as a response to South Korean President Moon Jae-in's renewed calls for a declaration to end the 1950-53 Korean War in a bid to promote peace on the Korean Peninsula. Seoul officials describe such a declaration as a ""political"" and ""symbolic"" step because a peace treaty is needed to be signed to formally end the Korean War which ended with an armistice leaving the peninsula in a technical state of war.The three-year conflict pitted South Korea and U.S.-led U.N. forces against North Korea and China killed 1 million to 2 million people. In his speech at the U.N. last week Moon proposed the end-of-the-war declaration be signed among the two Koreas the U.S. and China.After the North's launch Tuesday Moon ordered officials to examine its latest weapons firing and previous outreach in a comprehensive manner before formulating countermeasures according to Moon's office.A U.S.-led diplomatic effort aimed at convincing North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons in return for economic and political benefits has been stalled 2½ years. U.S. officials have repeatedly expressed hopes for further talks but have also made it clear the long-term sanctions imposed on North Korea will stay in place until the North takes concrete steps toward denuclearization.While North Korea has tested short-range weapons and vowed to continue building its nuclear arsenal Kim Jong Un has maintained a moratorium on testing longer-range weapons capable of reaching the American homeland an indication he wants to keep the chances for future diplomacy with the U.S. alive.North KoreaMoreSouth Korea has partial success with 1st launch into the space raceNorth Korea confirms test of missile designed for submarine launchN.

"Great white shark attacks are rare and when they do occur they are sometimes fatal. But attacks against the human species are often a result of mistaken identity new research published on Tuesday shows.Thestudy published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface was conducted by looking at humans and animals from a great white shark's eye view below the ocean surface. It's often been assumed that it's hard for sharks to differentiate between them but there is little research taking into account how sharks see rather than just from their perspective from underwater.Sharks according to the research have limited color perception if they are not completely color blind and have spatial resolving power that is ""considerably worse than humans."" So when they are looking for prey researchers found they more heavily rely on motion and brightness contrast.To determine how great white sharks primarily juveniles since they are most often the ones involved in human interactions might see objects when looking up from below the ocean surface researchers specifically compared video footage of rectangular floats humans swimming humans paddling surfboards and pinnipeds including sea lions and seals. The footage was filtered to mimic the sharks' visual system.And as it turns out the researchers found that juvenile great whites cannot significantly differentiate between the different life forms. The silhouettes of the different objects at the surface are too similar for the animals given their reliance on motion and light.""From the perspective of a white shark...neither visual motion nor shape cues allow an unequivocal visual distinction between pinnipeds and humans"" the study says ""supporting the mistaken identity theory behind some bites.""Laura Ryan the lead author of the study said in apress releasefrom Macquarie University that surfers are the most at-risk for fatal shark bites particularly from juveniles.""We found that surfers swimmers and pinnipeds (seals and sea lions) on the surface of the ocean will look the same to a white shark looking up from below because these sharks can't see fine details or colours"" she said.Professor Nathan Hart senior author of the study said thatgreat whiteshave to learn what to eat and their diet changes as they grow and learn. This could explain why juvenile sharks tend to be more commonly involved in biting humans. Adult sharks researchers said tend to have better vision and can better differentiate.""They need to develop a search image for these prey items and combine that with other sensory information"" Hart said. ""It's a learning process that could be prone to mistakes.""The study was also conducted in a controlled pool setting rather than the ocean leading researchers to believe that the sharks' ability to differentiate between humans and prey is actually worse because of the lower visibility in oceans. They also believe that the mistaken identity theory could apply to other shark species associated with human fatalities such as tiger sharks or bull sharks.But researchers also urged people to remember that shark bites are rare. In 2020 there were 57 confirmed unprovokedshark attack casesworldwide according to the University of Florida's International Shark Attack File. The 2015 to 2019 average was 80 incidents every year.They also reiterated that sharks themselves are endangered. In January scientists announced that shark and ray populations havedeclined more than 70%over the past 50 years with overfishing being a main culprit. Fish nets and drum lines often placed under water to ward off the animals only further threaten the species and other marine life researchers of the great white study found.They hope their findings can help find better ways to prevent future shark bites and provide an overall better understanding of the creatures that are vital to marine ecosystems.""Understanding why shark bites occur can help us find ways to prevent them"" Ryan said ""while keeping both humans and sharks safer.""Direction and strength of motion cues from the 2DMD model of (a–c) a pinniped swimming (d–f) a human paddling a surfboard (g–i) a human swimming and (j–l) a rectangular float towed through the water.

"London — Queen Elizabeth II will not attend the upcomingCOP26 climate conferencein Glasgow Scotland following medical advice to rest Buckingham Palace said Tuesday. The queenspent a night in the hospitallast week to undergo preliminary checks according to the Palace — her first overnight stay in eight years.""Her Majesty is disappointed not to attend the Reception but will deliver a message to the assembled delegates via a recorded video message"" Buckingham Palace said in a statement.The 95-year-old queen resumed official engagements on Tuesday carrying out virtual events from Windsor Castle. She is limiting herself to light duties however canceling a recent planned trip to Northern Ireland. In recent weeks she has been seen using a walking stick. Her hospital stay was only confirmed by the Palace after being reported by the tabloid press.The Prince of Wales as well as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are still scheduled to attend the Glasgow climate summit.The Press Association news agency reported it was hoped that world leaders would not use the queen's absence as an excuse not to attend the conference. She had previously been picked up on video appearing to express irritation at the global lack of action on climate change.""I've been hearing all about COP... still don't know who is coming... no idea"" she appeared to say in a video showing her speaking with Camilla the Duchess of Cornwall. ""We only know about people who are not coming...

"Great white shark attacks are rare and when they do occur they are sometimes fatal. But attacks against the human species are often a result of mistaken identity new research published on Tuesday shows.Thestudy published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface was conducted by looking at humans and animals from a great white shark's eye view below the ocean surface. It's often been assumed that it's hard for sharks to differentiate between them but there is little research taking into account how sharks see rather than just from their perspective from underwater.Sharks according to the research have limited color perception if they are not completely color blind and have spatial resolving power that is ""considerably worse than humans."" So when they are looking for prey researchers found they more heavily rely on motion and brightness contrast.To determine how great white sharks primarily juveniles since they are most often the ones involved in human interactions might see objects when looking up from below the ocean surface researchers specifically compared video footage of rectangular floats humans swimming humans paddling surfboards and pinnipeds including sea lions and seals. The footage was filtered to mimic the sharks' visual system.And as it turns out the researchers found that juvenile great whites cannot significantly differentiate between the different life forms. The silhouettes of the different objects at the surface are too similar for the animals given their reliance on motion and light.""From the perspective of a white shark...neither visual motion nor shape cues allow an unequivocal visual distinction between pinnipeds and humans"" the study says ""supporting the mistaken identity theory behind some bites.""Laura Ryan the lead author of the study said in apress releasefrom Macquarie University that surfers are the most at-risk for fatal shark bites particularly from juveniles.""We found that surfers swimmers and pinnipeds (seals and sea lions) on the surface of the ocean will look the same to a white shark looking up from below because these sharks can't see fine details or colours"" she said.Professor Nathan Hart senior author of the study said thatgreat whiteshave to learn what to eat and their diet changes as they grow and learn. This could explain why juvenile sharks tend to be more commonly involved in biting humans. Adult sharks researchers said tend to have better vision and can better differentiate.""They need to develop a search image for these prey items and combine that with other sensory information"" Hart said. ""It's a learning process that could be prone to mistakes.""The study was also conducted in a controlled pool setting rather than the ocean leading researchers to believe that the sharks' ability to differentiate between humans and prey is actually worse because of the lower visibility in oceans. They also believe that the mistaken identity theory could apply to other shark species associated with human fatalities such as tiger sharks or bull sharks.But researchers also urged people to remember that shark bites are rare. In 2020 there were 57 confirmed unprovokedshark attack casesworldwide according to the University of Florida's International Shark Attack File. The 2015 to 2019 average was 80 incidents every year.They also reiterated that sharks themselves are endangered. In January scientists announced that shark and ray populations havedeclined more than 70%over the past 50 years with overfishing being a main culprit. Fish nets and drum lines often placed under water to ward off the animals only further threaten the species and other marine life researchers of the great white study found.They hope their findings can help find better ways to prevent future shark bites and provide an overall better understanding of the creatures that are vital to marine ecosystems.""Understanding why shark bites occur can help us find ways to prevent them"" Ryan said ""while keeping both humans and sharks safer.""Direction and strength of motion cues from the 2DMD model of (a–c) a pinniped swimming (d–f) a human paddling a surfboard (g–i) a human swimming and (j–l) a rectangular float towed through the water. Modelling was performed assuming a spatial resolving power of either 5 cpd (behk) or 2.5 cpd (cfil).

"Cheers rang out hugs were exchanged and rainbow-colored flags waved overhead across Switzerland as the Swiss resoundingly voted to allow same-sex couples to marry final results of a nationwide referendum showed Sunday.Official results showed the measure passed with 64.1% of the vote while more than half of all voters approved in each of Switzerland's 26 cantons or states. The vote - years in the making - is set to bring the Alpine nation into line with many others in western Europe and wraps up an often tense campaign between rival sides.Operation Libero stages a photo opportunity of a marriage with three different couples in Bern Sunday Sept. 26 2021.Peter Schneider / APJustice Minister Karin Keller-Sutter tweeted that the government will implement the decision quickly and under current plans the new rules can take effect on July 1.Switzerland's parliament and the governing Federal Council - on which she sits - had supported the ""Marriage for All"" measure which marks a key step for greater rights for gays and lesbians in Switzerland. The country has authorized same-sex civil partnerships since 2007.""With this all couples will in the future be treated equally before the law: all can enter into a civil marriage with the same rights and obligations"" Keller-Sutter wrote.Passage is set to put same-sex partners on an equal legal footing with heterosexual couples by allowing them to adopt children and facilitating citizenship for same-sex spouses. It will also permit lesbian couples to utilize regulated sperm donation.""This is a historic day for us and for Switzerland this is a great step forward something we have been waiting for years"" said Laura Russo co-president of the Geneva Federation of LGBT Associations at a gathering of joyous supporters of the measure along a Geneva pedestrian street. ""This initiative was begun in 2013; we had to wait 8 years for the vote to happen - and here this is a big 'Yes.'""Opponents believe that replacing civil partnerships with full marriage rights would undermine families based on a union between a man and a woman.Benjamin Roduit of the Christian Democratic People's Party which spearheaded the effort to stop same-sex marriage claimed at least some success in raising awareness about his party's positions despite the defeat at the ballot box.""On our side we have tried to draw attention to the central problem the one of children and medically assisted procreation"" he said. ""On that point I think we have succeeded in raising awareness among the Swiss people and we will still be here when other steps will be proposed.""The campaign has been rife with allegations of unfair tactics with the opposing sides decrying the ripping down of posters LGBT hotlines getting flooded with complaints hostile emails shouted insults against campaigners and efforts to silence opposing views.Switzerland which has a population of 8.5 million is traditionally conservative and only extended the right to vote to all women in the country in 1990.Most countries in Western Europe already recognize same-sex marriage while most of those in Central and Eastern Europe don't permit wedlock between two men or two women.At a polling station in Geneva voter Anna Leimgruber said she cast her ballot for the ""no"" camp because she believed ""children would need to have a dad and a mom.""But Nicolas Dzierlatka who voted ""yes"" said what children need is love.""I think what's important for children is that they are loved and respected - and I think there are children who are not respected or loved in so-called 'hetero' couples"" he said.Also on Sunday voters dismissed a proposal spearheaded by left-wing groups to raise taxes on returns from investments and capital such as dividends or income from rental properties in Switzerland as a way to ensure better redistribution and fairer taxation.Results showed 64.9% voting against it in a country known for its vibrant financial sector and relatively low taxes and as a haven for many of the world's richest people.

"Germany's center-left Social Democrats won the biggest share of the vote in a national election Sunday narrowly beatingoutgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel's center-right Union bloc in a closely fought race that will determine who succeeds the long-time leader at the helm of Europe's biggest economy.The Social Democrats' candidate Olaf Scholz the outgoing vice chancellor and finance minister who pulled his party out of a years-long slump said the outcome was ""a very clear mandate to ensure now that we put together a good pragmatic government for Germany.""Despite getting its worst-ever result in a federal contest the Union bloc said it too would reach out to smaller parties to discuss forming a government while Merkel stays on in a caretaker role until a successor is sworn in.Election officials said early Monday that a count of all 299 constituencies showed the Social Democrats received 25.9% of the vote ahead of 24.1% for the Union bloc. No winning party in a German national election had previously taken less than 31% of the vote.Armin Laschet the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia state who outmaneuvered a more popular rival to secure the nomination of Merkel's Union bloc had struggled to motivate the party's base and suffered a series of missteps.Olaf Scholz Finance Minister and SPD candidate for Chancellor waves during the election party at Willy Brandt House on September 26 2021.Britta Pedersen/Picture Alliance via Getty Images""Of course this is a loss of votes that isn't pretty"" Laschet said of results that looked set to undercut by some measure the Union's previous worst showing of 31% in 1949. But he added that with Merkel departing after 16 years in power ""no one had an incumbent bonus in this election.""Laschet told supporters that ""we will do everything we can to form a government under the Union's leadership because Germany now needs a coalition for the future that modernizes our country.""Both Laschet and Scholz will be courting the same two parties: the environmentalist Greens who were third with 14.8%; and the pro-business Free Democrats who took 11.5% of the vote.The Greens traditionally lean toward the Social Democrats and the Free Democrats toward the Union but neither ruled out going the other way.The other option was a repeat of the outgoing ""grand coalition"" of the Union and Social Democrats that has run Germany for 12 of Merkel's 16 years in power but there was little obvious appetite for that after years of government squabbling.""Everyone thinks that ... this 'grand coalition' isn't promising for the future regardless of who is No. 1 and No. 2"" Laschet said. ""We need a real new beginning.""The Free Democrats' leader Christian Lindner appeared keen to govern suggesting that his party and the Greens should make the first move.""About 75% of Germans didn't vote for the next chancellor's party"" Lindner said in a post-election debate with all parties' leaders on public broadcaster ZDF. ""So it might be advisable ... that the Greens and Free Democrats first speak to each other to structure everything that follows.""Baerbock insisted that ""the climate crisis ... is the leading issue of the next government and that is for us the basis for any talks ... even if we aren't totally satisfied with our result.""While the Greens improved their support from the last election in 2017 they had higher expectations for Sunday's vote.The co-leader of Germany's Green party (Die Gruenen) and the party's candidate for chancellor Annalena Baerbock (L) and co-leader of Germany's Green party (Die Gruenen) Robert Habeck wave at their electoral party after estimates were broadcast on television in Berlin on September 26 2021 after the German general elections.DAVID GANNON/AFP via Getty ImagesThe Left Party was projected to win only 4.9% of the vote and risked being kicked out of parliament entirely. The far-right Alternative for Germany — which no one else wants to work with — received 10.3%. This was about 2 percentage points less than in 2017 when it first entered parliament.Due to Germany's complicated electoral system a full breakdown of the result by seats in parliament was still pending.Merkel who has won plaudits for steering Germany through several major crises won't be an easy leader to follow. Her successor will have to oversee the country's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic which Germany so far has weathered relatively well thanks to large rescue programs.Germany's leading parties have significant differences when it comes to taxation and tackling climate change.Foreign policy didn't feature much in the campaign although the Greens favor a tougher stance toward China and Russia.Whichever parties form the next German government the Free Democrats' Lindner said it was ""good news"" that it would have a majority with centrist parties.""All of those in Europe and beyond who were worried about Germany's stability can now see: Germany will be stable in any case"" he said.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez sent early congratulations to Scholz.""Spain and Germany will continue to work together for a stronger Europe and for a fair and green recovery that leaves no one behind"" he wrote on Twitter.In two regional elections also held Sunday the Social Democrats looked set to defend the post of Berlin mayor that they have held for two decades. The party was also on course for a strong win in the northeastern state of Mecklenburg Western-Pomerania.For the first time since 1949 the Danish minority party SSW was set to win a seat in parliament officials said.Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical advicePablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";Social Democrats beat Merkel's bloc in German elections;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/german-election-social-democrats-union-angela-merkel-olaf-scholz/;mindset;0.930000
"Two Canadians detained in Chinaon spying chargeshave been released from prison and flown out of the country Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Friday hours after a top executive of Chinese communications giant Huawei Technologiesresolved criminal chargesagainst her in a deal with the U.S. Justice Department.Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were arrested in China in December 2018shortly afterCanada arrested Meng Wanzhou Huawei's chief financial officer and the daughter of the company's founder on a U.S. extradition request. Many countries labeled China's action ""hostage politics.""The deal with Meng calls for the Justice Department to dismiss fraud charges late next year in exchange for Meng accepting responsibility for misrepresenting her company's business dealings in Iran. Trudeau called a news conference Friday night about an hour after Meng's plane left Canada for China.The arrangement with Meng known as a deferred prosecution agreement resolves a yearslong legal and geopolitical tussle that involved not only the U.S. and China but also Canada where Meng has remained since she was arrested at Vancouver's airport in December 2018.A video screen displays images of Canadians Michael Kovrig left and Michael Spavor at an event held in connection with the announcement of the sentence for Spavor at the Canadian Embassy in Beijing Wednesday August 11 2021. A Chinese court has sentenced Spavor to 11 years on spying charges in case linked to Huawei.Mark Schiefelbein / APThe deal was reached as President Joe Biden and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping have sought to tamp down signs of public tension — even as the world's two dominant economies are at odds on issues as diverse as cybersecurity climate change human rights and trade and tariffs. Biden said in an address before the U.N. General Assembly earlier this week that he had no intention of starting a ""new Cold War"" while Xi told world leaders that disputes among countries ""need to be handled through dialogue and cooperation.""As part of the deal disclosed in federal court in Brooklyn the Justice Department agreed to dismiss the fraud charges against Meng in December 2022 — exactly four years after her arrest — provided that she complies with certain conditions including not contesting any of the government's factual allegations. The Justice Department also agreed to drop its request that Meng be extradited to the U.S. which she had vigorously challenged ending a process that prosecutors said could have persisted for months.Meng's attorneys said they fully expect the charges to be dismissed in 14 months. ""We're very pleased that in the meantime she can go home to her family"" said defense lawyer Michelle Levin.After appearing via videoconference for her New York hearing Meng made a brief court appearance in Vancouver where she has been out on bail and living in her mansion since her arrest. The court released her from all her bail conditions and she is now free to leave the country.Outside the courtroom Meng thanked the Canadian government for upholding the rule of law expressed gratitude to the Canadian people and apologized ""for the inconvenience I caused.""""Over the last three years my life has been turned upside down"" she said. ""It was a disruptive time for me as a mother a wife and as a company executive. But I believe every cloud has a silver lining. It really was an invaluable experience in my life. I will never forget all the good wishes I received.""Shortly afterward Meng left on an Air China flight for Shenzhen China the location of Huawei's headquarters.Huawei is the biggest global supplier of network gear for phone and internet companies. It has been a symbol of China's progress in becoming a technological world power — and a subject of U.S. security and law enforcement concerns. Some analysts say Chinese companies have flouted international rules and norms and stolen technology.The case against Meng stems from a January 2019 indictment from the Trump administration Justice Department that accused Huawei of stealing trade secrets and using a Hong Kong shell company called Skycom to sell equipment to Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions. The indictment also charged Meng herself with committing fraud by misleading the HSBC bank about the company's business dealings in Iran.The indictment came amid a broader Trump administration crackdown against Huawei over U.S. government concerns that the company's products could facilitate Chinese spying. The administration cut off Huawei's access to U.S. components and technology including Google's music and other smartphone services and later barred vendors worldwide from using U.S. technology to produce components for Huawei.The Biden White House meanwhile has kept up a hard line on Huawei and other Chinese corporations whose technology is thought to pose national security risks.Huawei has repeatedly denied the U.S. government's allegations and security concerns about its products.Meng had long fought the Justice Department's extradition request with her lawyers calling the case against her flawed and alleging that she was being used as a ""bargaining chip"" in political gamesmanship. They cited a 2018 interview in which then-President Donald Trump said he'd be willing to intervene in the case if it would help secure a trade deal with China or aid U.S. security interests.Last month a Canadian judge held off on ruling whether Meng should be extradited to the U.S. after a Canadian Justice Department lawyer wrapped up his case saying there was enough evidence to show she was dishonest and deserved to stand trial in the U.S.Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesPablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical adviceGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";Canadians detained on spying charges in China released;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/canadians-michael-kovrig-michael-spavor-china-huawei-meng-wanzhou/;mindset;0.930000
"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said in an exclusive interview with CBS News this week that his government intends to defy the U.S. and go ahead with the purchase of another Russian-made anti-aircraft missile defense system despite repeated warnings that it puts the security of the NATO alliance at risk.Erdoğan confirmed his plans to CBS News chief foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan after she asked him about Russian government claims that Turkey would purchase more S-400 systems.""I explained everything to President Biden"" Erdoğan said in an interview taped Tuesday on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York claiming that America's refusal to sell Turkey the U.S.-made Patriots system as an alternative had led his government to purchase the Russian system instead. The U.S. has disputed this claim.Both the Trump and Biden administrations have maintained that the Russian S-400 system is a danger if activated in the same country that flies F-35 jets. The U.S. government has said the S-400 would collect detailed information about the F-35s possibly erasing their stealth advantages. Turkey had previously bought F-35 jets which gave the NATO member a role in their production. But in retaliation for Turkey's S-400 purchase the Trump administration halted its delivery of the F-35s dropped Turkey from the program and imposed sanctions on Turkish defense officials.Despite this Erdoğan has remained defiant.""So it sounds like you still intend to buy another round of these S-400s of these Russian missile systems?"" Brennan asked. ""So the sanctions will stay on?""""In the future nobody will be able to interfere in terms of what kind of defense systems we acquire from which country at what level. Nobody can interfere with that. We are the only ones to make such decisions"" Erdogan responded.""That sounds like a yes."" Brennan said.""Of course of course yes"" Erdoğan said. He later confirmed that he plans to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the end of the month. The two are expected to discuss a number of issues including Syria.During the interview Erdoğan also told CBS News that he would prefer that the U.S. pull out its remaining 900 troops in neighboring Syria. Turkey's forces have remained in the northern part of the country since its military incursion to fight U.S.-allied Kurdish forces after former President Donald Trump attempted to withdraw all U.S. troops in the fall of 2019.This is just one of many irritants in the relationship between the U.S. and Turkey which remains a key power in the Middle East and a NATO member. As a presidential candidate Mr. Biden told The New York Times' editorial board inJanuary 2020that Erdoğan was ""an autocrat"" and cited his expansive powers and abuse of power. Erdoğan seemed to brush off the criticism.""Mr. President's definition of an autocrat remains unknown to me I don't know what he meant"" Erdoğan told Brennan. He also said that Mr. Biden has never raised any concern about human rights abuse issues to him during their personal conversations. National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne did not return CBS News' request for comment.As per theCommittee for the Protection of Journalists' 2020 worldwide ranking indexTurkey is the second worst jailer of journalists — second only to China — and worse than Iran and Saudi Arabia. Erdoğan's government also arrested and charged some 36000 people in Turkey whom it accused of criticizing him or being connected to figures it believes were responsible for the attempted coup to overthrow him in 2016.Mr. Biden last met with Erdoğan in Brussels this past June. At the time it appeared there might be an opportunity for a breakthrough in the troubled relationship. Erdoğan told CBS News that it was Mr. Biden who asked him to consider having Turkish forces run the airport in Kabul in the wake of the U.S. withdrawal. It was a key opportunity and Erdoğan said he was open to the idea on the condition of logistical and financial support.""It's including financial and equipment support the ammunitions the vehicles and the weapons there would have been transferred to us. But such things have unfolded that the exact opposite happened"" Erdoğan said.The U.S. withdrawal and the chaotic way it was carried out left NATO troops scrambling as well. Turkey which has the second largest army in NATO also pulled out of the country.""The artillery the ammunition the weapons and the vehicles at the Karzai airport were all transferred over to the Taliban and the Taliban is currently using all those weapons and all those vehicles and we have to see all these facts for what they are"" he said.Since the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan last month both Qatar and Turkey have offered to provide technical support to their emerging government in order to keep their airports operating. That provided Turkey with the chance to be a power broker and essentially provide the Taliban with a lifeline to the rest of the world. Erdoğan said that at this point there is no deal to work with the Taliban.In an interview that will air on Sunday's ""Face the Nation"" Erdoğan laid out what he described as his requirements to do business with the Taliban.Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesPablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical adviceSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsMargaret BrennanMargaret Brennan is moderator of CBS News' ""Face The Nation"" and CBS News' senior foreign affairs correspondent based in Washington D.C.";Turkey's president defiant about acquiring Russian missile defense system;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/erdogan-defiant-about-acquiring-russian-missile-defense-system-despite-potential-risk-for-u-s/;mindset;0.930000

The accused allegedly filmed the rape and then used the video to blackmail the victim for subsequent sexual assaults said police.""It all started when a friend of the girl raped her in January and made a video of the incident. He started blackmailing her on the basis of that video. Later on his friends and acquaintances gang-raped her at least on four to five occasions at different places"" Dattatray Karale an additional commissioner with the Maharashtra Police told reporters Thursday.India has reported several cases where criminals use videos of rapes to blackmail the victims threatening to leak the video to social media or send it to her family.In this case the teenaged victim was allegedly raped at several places in Maharashtra state where Dombivali and Mumbai are located including Badlapur Rabale and Murbad. She had managed to hide the alleged serial abuse from her family until Wednesday. Her family approached police when they found out but it's not clear how they learned of the alleged abuse.The 28 people arrested include two minors who will be treated as juveniles and possibly face a ""correction"" time in a home. The rest of the 26 accused have been charged under various sections of rape in the Indian Penal Code and also under a stricter law: the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. If convictedthe suspects face possible sentences of 20 years to life imprisonment.Twenty-six suspects were arrested Thursday and two more were arrested Friday. The police are looking for five others suspected of being involved.

"An undated photo provided by the Metropolitan Police on September 23 2021 shows Sabina Nessa who was murdered in a park in south London very near her home.Metropolitan Police via APLondon— The murder of a 28-year-old London elementary school teacher has reignited outrage over the prevalence of violence against women in the U.K. and fueled a debate playing out on both sides of the Atlantic over how much attention crimes get in the media depending on the race of the victim.London police investigating the killing of Sabina Nessa made an arrest on Thursday but on Friday evening they said he had been released pending further investigation. No other suspects were in custody as of Friday so the killer or killers remained at large.Police say Nessa was making a five-minute walk from her home to a nearby bar to meet a friend when she was attacked. Her body was discovered the next day.Spike in women being killed by men during U.K. COVID lockdownNessa's southeast London community of Kidbrooke has organized a candlelight vigil for Friday evening to honor her life. It was to be held in a square near to where her body was found. The vigil will end with a minute of silence at 8:30 p.m. to mark the time she left her home.Many have paid tribute to her character including the head teacher of the school where she worked who told BBC News she was ""a brilliant teacher… kind caring and absolutely dedicated to her pupils.""Nessa's cousin told the BBC she was ""the most caring person kindest sweetest girl you could meet"" and added: ""Her parents are absolutely shocked. They're inconsolable still and understandably so. To hear of their daughter being taken away from them by some cowardly man is just horrific.""The police and local government have been criticized for their response to the murder. The local government in Kidbrooke has handed out 200 personal alarms to women and vulnerable people in the area. Police distributed information sheets with tips for staying safe on the streets including recommendations to ""plan your route in advance"" ""tell someone where you're going"" and ""stick to busy places.""The advice drew a quick public backlash with many pointing out that Nessa was attacked while making a short walk through a busy park in her own neighborhood.""It's not our fault that we keep getting killed"" Jaime Klingler co-founder of the activist group Reclaim These Streets told CBS News. ""This is not on us and they need to stop putting it on us.""Klingler believes that while both the police and U.K. government officials have talked a lot about women's safety especially in the wake of the highly publicizedmurder of Sarah Everardby a police officer earlier year there hasn't been effective action taken to address the problem.Police officer on trial for U.K. woman murder...01:33Klingler dismissed a recent government report on police responses to violence against women and girls as ""158 pages of 'we need to make women more of a priority' but there wasn't one thing saying: 'these are the steps we have to take to improve.'""Reacting to the backlash on Friday London Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Louisa Rolfe said the force was not in fact urging women to change their own behavior to avoid assault.""It's really important to us that we don't ask women to change their behaviour"" she said. ""Violence against women and girls is a priority for police across the U.K. but we're really conscious that women should be free to go about their lives without fear of abuse.""She said violence against women had the ""hallmarks of an epidemic"" and that it was ""tolerated far too much in society and we the police are determined to bring offenders to justice and to prevent these offenses where we can.""Nessa's murder has also reinvigorated discussion in the U.K. about so-called ""Missing White Woman Syndrome.""London Councillor Rabina Khan defines the term first coined by American journalistGwen Ifill as: ""The disproportionate media coverage of missing people and victims of violent crime if you are young white middle-class women in comparison to someone who's not white.""New attention to missing Indigenous people05:04Khan and many others have drawn parallels between Nessa's murder and Everard's. Everard was murdered by a London police officer who didn't know her but who had previously been accused of flashing a woman.""I was really pleased and proud that the Duchess of Cambridge attended the vigil of Sarah Everard and I hope tonight this evening that we see many [high] profile people attending Sabina Nessa's vigil"" Khan said on British TV Friday morning.Klingler said that when it comes to cases involving women of color there generally aren't ""the alarm bells"" or the public feeling of ""this could be my daughter — there wasn't the outrage.""She pointed to the murders ofBibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman two Black sisters who were killed in London in June 2020.""It was barely reported"" she said. ""The day the court case started there was nothing in the papers. That case was one of the most horrific things I've read in my life."" The police service's handling of that caseprompted three investigationsinto police misconduct.Klingler said the issue of femicide still wasn't ""even in the top-three priorities of police stations.""""I would love to say I stood up I went on TV shows I did all this work and look what we changed. In reality nothing's changed"" she said. ""None of us feel any safer.""A 38-year-old man was arrested on Thursday in connection with the investigation into Nessa's murder but on Friday evening London's Metropolitan Police said he had been released without charge. He remained a subject of the investigation.The police alsoreleased imageson Thursday of another man caught on security cameras in the area who they want to speak with regarding the case.

"Berlin— German Chancellor Angela Merkel is about to leave her post as leader of Europe's biggest economy after 16 years in power. Just a few months ago the race to succeed her looked over before it really even started with her center-right party's candidate Armin Laschet holding a solid lead in the polls.But days before Germans were to cast their votes to elect a new government on Sunday September 26 Merkel's anointed successor found his campaign wallowing in the wake of gaffes and at pains to convince a flood-battered nation that now is not the time for a sharp shift to the left in both domestic and foreign policy.German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) chancellor candidate Armin Laschet (L) greet supporters at the conclusion of an election campaign rally September 21 2021 in Stralsund Germany.Sean Gallup/Getty""The promise that he entered the election campaign with that he is a continuation of Angela Merkel's pragmatic but warm style he is not living up to that promise"" Professor Christoph Nguyen a political scientist at the Free University of Berlin told CBS News. ""There have been some key gaffes where he has been seen laughing during a very sombre speech during the floods.""This summer's floods claimed almost 200 lives. It was the biggest natural disaster in recent German history and itpushed climate change—and Germany's progressive Greens party — to the top of the election agenda.Severe flooding in Europe and U.S.03:26But more recently the Greens have lost ground too ceding headway to the Social Democratic Party (SPD). The center-left party has been the junior coalition partner in Merkel's government for the last eight years and the SPD's Olaf Scholz has been her vice chancellor for the last three.Apparently appealing to voters who want something more akin to the status quo the plain-speaking politician now appears to be on track to become Germany's next chancellor.""He was a great finance minister he is globally connected he's a champion of Europe — whether that makes him a great Chancellor I don't know but I think he has a good chance"" Berlin resident Andreas Schleicher told CBS News of Scholz just a couple days before the election.German Minister of Finance and Social Democratic Party (SPD) top candidate for the federal elections Olaf Scholz looks on before a TV debate on September 23 2021 in Berlin Germany.Clemens Bilan/Pool/GettyGermany's electoral system almost always leads to the formation of a coalition government in which no single figure or party has the power to sway the country's fortunes alone.Merkel is widely considered one of the most effective European leaders of recent times and whoever takes the reins from her and whoever they decide to partner up with will have their work cut out for them. That work will include resetting transatlantic ties after Europe bristled over the U.S. government's chaotic withdrawal fromAfghanistan.Wolfgang Ischinger head of the Munich Security Conference and a former German ambassador to the U.S. told CBS News that with Merkel's departure the U.S. will undoubtedly lose a well-known and reliable partner.U.S. President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Angela Merkel hold a joint press conference in the East Room of the White House in Washington D.C. July 15 2021.SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty""The good news is that regardless of the outcome of our elections it is a foregone conclusion that the next government will not become hostile to the United States"" he told CBS News.But that's not the message that Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party has been giving German voters in the run-up to the election. The specter of a potential left-wing coalition built by the SPD and the Greens and possibly including the former communist Die Linke (The Left) party is one that Laschet hopes will scare centrist voters back into his own party's familiar center-right arms.""Does anyone really believe in a party that wants to override constitutional norms that wants to leave NATO that has voted against every European unification measure?"" he asked during a recent campaign rally in Berlin trying to instil fear over Die Linke's genuine anti-NATO stance and its refusal to back military deployments with European partners.Scholz's Social Democrats insist they will not compromise on their more centrist values regardless of any potential coalition partners. But their rivals in Merkel's CDU say it's clear the party wants to form an alliance with the left — and to pull Germany's national and international politics in that direction in the process.The real question as anincreasingly assertive Russialooms large to the east and ties with Washington await repair is just howfarto the left Merkel's departure will see the country slide.Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesPablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical adviceSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";After 16 years Merkel's time is up and Germany's heading left;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/germany-angela-merkel-election-2021-to-bring-shift-to-the-left/;mindset;0.930000

It's often been assumed that it's hard for sharks to differentiate between them but there is little research taking into account how sharks see rather than just from their perspective from underwater.Sharks according to the research have limited color perception if they are not completely color blind and have spatial resolving power that is ""considerably worse than humans.""

The footage was filtered to mimic the sharks' visual system.And as it turns out the researchers found that juvenile great whites cannot significantly differentiate between the different life forms.

Heidi Crowter 26 and two others took the Department of Health and Social Care to court arguing that part of the Abortion Act is discriminatory and violates the European Convention on Human Rights.Abortions in England Wales and Scotland are allowed until 24 weeks of pregnancy. But the law states that terminations can be allowed up until birth if there's ""a substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped"" which includes Down syndrome.Crowter has said that she found the legislation ""offensive"" and disrespectful and that she wanted to change the law to challenge people's perception of Down syndrome.EU doctor prescribes abortion pills to Texas women despite new lawsTwo judges dismissed the case Thursday after a two-day hearing concluding that the legislation isn't unlawful and that it aims to strike a balance between the rights of the unborn child and that of women.Crowter brought the case with Maire Lea-Wilson 33 who has a son with Down syndrome and an unidentified child with the condition.She said she plans to appeal the ruling.""The fight is not over"" Crowter said outside the Royal Courts of Justice in central London surrounded by supporters.""We face discrimination every day in schools in the workplace and in society.

"The World Health Organization tightened its global air quality guidelines Wednesday in its first revision since 2005. The organization said air pollution is one of the ""biggest environmental threats to human health.""""Clean air is fundamental to health"" the WHOsaid. ""Compared to 15 years ago when the previous edition of these guidelines was published there is now a much stronger body of evidence to show how air pollution affects different aspects of health at even lower concentrations than previously understood.""Landmark ruling blames air pollution in girl's deathUnder the guidelines the WHO lowered recommended exposure levels to key pollutants including ozone nitrogen dioxide sulfur dioxide carbon monoxide and particulate matter. They were adjusted to account for the latest evidence that shows the health effects from exposure. The study found particulate matter ""equal or smaller than 10 and 2.5 microns (µm) in diameter"" are particularly dangerous having the ability to travel deep into either the lungs or the bloodstream.A man walks along a path amidst smog and fog conditions during a cold morning in Faridabad India on February 6 2019. Smog levels spike during winter in north India when air quality often eclipses the World Health Organization's safe levels.Money Sharma / AFP/Getty ImagesAccording to the WHO exposure to air pollution results in 7 million premature deaths every year as well as the loss of millions of more healthy years of life.""In children this could include reduced lung growth and function respiratory infections and aggravated asthma"" the WHO said. ""In adults ischaemic heart disease and stroke are the most common causes of premature death attributable to outdoor air pollution and evidence is also emerging of other effects such as diabetes and neurodegenerative conditions. This puts the burden of disease attributable to air pollution on a par with other major global health risks such as unhealthy diet and tobacco smoking.""The organization said the effects of air pollution are more prevalent in low income communities and countries.""Disparities in air pollution exposure are increasing worldwide particularly as low- and middle-income countries are experiencing growing levels of air pollution because of large-scale urbanization and economic development that has largely relied on the burning of fossil fuels"" the WHO said.The group called for countries to make ""gradual progress in improving air quality marked by the achievement of interim targets"" with the ultimate goal of staying under recommended pollution levels.""We know the magnitude of the problem and we know how to solve it"" WHO Regional Director for Europe Dr. Hans Henri P.

The gravity of what was accomplished is not lost on him.""I feel very proud"" he said in an interview with CBS News on Wednesday along with his father and coach Tony. ""I'm happy and I can't wait to get back to training.""Tony said that seeing his son ""safe"" was all his family cared about.

"Vilnius Lithuania— Lithuanian cybersecurity experts are urging the country's government agencies to abandon the use of Chinese-made smartphones after an investigation identified security vulnerabilities and censorship concerns with certain devices. Lithuania's National Cyber Security Center said it found four major cybersecurity risks for devices made byHuaweiandXiaomi including two relating to pre-installed apps and one involving personal data leakage and warned against using these two brands.There's also the risk of possible restrictions on freedom of expression with Xiaomi phones which contain a content-filtering feature for 449 keywords or groups of keywords in Chinese characters. The center warned the function could be activated at any time and did not rule out the possibility that words using Latin characters could be added. According to the Lithuanian report apps receive updated lists of censored words and phrases and are capable of blocking them.U.S. and allies accuse China of widespread cybercrimeThe phrases include ""Free Tibet"" ""Voice of America"" ""Democratic Movement"" and ""Long Live Taiwan Independence."" Although the content-filtering feature was disabled and no censorship was performed on the phones the Lithuanian center inspected the center warned the function could be activated at any time.A Huawei representative in China referred CBS News to a previous statement issued to media outlets saying simply that the company's phonesdo not send user's data externally.Huawei CEO denies spying01:11A Xiaomi spokesperson told CBS News that the company's ""devices do not censor communications to or from its users. Xiaomi has never and will never restrict or block any personal behaviors of our smartphone users such as searching calling web browsing or the use of third-party communication software. Xiaomi fully respects and protects the legal rights of all users. Xiaomi complies with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).""The cybersecurity center which is a Defense Ministry agency also investigated phones made by another Chinese company OnePlus but found no problems.""We strongly recommend that state and public institutions not use those devices and plan to initiate legislation which regulates acquiring certain devices for the ministries and various state agencies"" Deputy Defense Minister Margiris Abukevicius said Wednesday.More than 200 public authorities have purchased such phones and over 4500 phones are in use ""which in our opinion increases the risks"" Abukevicius said. He didn't specify the makes of all the phones.The center's investigation released Tuesday was done ""to ensure the safe use of 5G mobile devices sold in our country and the software they contain"" he said.Also ordinary ""people should also know what's inside these phones about the certain software and consider safety before making their decisions"" the minister said.Xiaomi's Mi 3 smartphoneAloysius Low/CNETThe Beijing-based Xiaomi known for its value-for-money devices became the world's No. 2 smartphone maker by sales this year trailing only Samsung. The company was put on a U.S. Defense Department blacklist in the last few days of the Trump administration which accused it of links to China's military. It was later removed after suing the U.S. government and denies having any links with China's People's Liberation Army.The move comes amid tensions between Lithuania and China.Earlier this month Lithuania recalled its ambassador to China following the Baltic country's decision in July to allow Taiwan to open an office in its capital under its own name. In August China recalled its ambassador to Lithuania and told the Baltic nation to ""immediately rectify its wrong decision.""China says Taiwan is part of its territory and doesn't have the right to diplomatic recognition although the island maintains informal ties with all major nations through trade offices including in the United States and Japan. Chinese pressure has reduced Taiwan's formal diplomatic allies to just 15.Taiwan and Lithuania agreed in July that the office in the capital Vilnius set to open this fall will bear the name Taiwan rather than Chinese Taipei - a term often used in other countries in order not to offend Beijing. On Wednesday Lithuania said it was sending another 236000 COVID-19 vaccines to Taiwan.Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical advicePablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";Lithuania says Chinese-made phones have built-in security risks;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lithuania-china-cybersecurity-risks-chinese-xiaomi-huawei-smartphones/;mindset;0.930000

She called it ""a fight for the rights and dignity of women.""The toppling of the Taliban regime and the ensuing 20 years of war did deliver significant gains for women's rights. But it has taken the Islamic extremists just over a month to erase those hard-won achievements.#talibanare changed last time they would beat woman in public with belt  this Time they are doing it with iron rod .#Kabulpic.twitter.com/nuEm1hHOI1— Adnan Khan (@AdnanJrnlst)September 8 2021The new Taliban regime which looks remarkably like the one that ruled over the country until it was toppled by the U.S.-led invasion has closed the government ministry dedicated to women's affairs. It's preventing female students from returning to schools and universities. Female workers in an array of professions have been told to stay home until further notice. Videos show Taliban enforcers flogging women on the streets in broad daylight for unknown transgressions.Vulnerable women with ""nowhere to go""On September 16 Taliban officials removed signs identifying the Ministry of Women's Affairs from the government building in Kabul. They were immediately replaced with new signage heralding the return of the long-feared ""Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice.""The Ministry of Women's Affairs established soon after the Taliban were toppled in 2001 and boasting 90% female staff was tasked with empowering and protecting the country's women and girls. It has run safe houses for women fleeing abusive families for years and it has saved hundreds of women's lives every year according to Halima Prastish who was the director of women's affairs in Ghor province before she fled into hiding.Prastish said that after the Taliban takeover she had to hand 30 vulnerable women back to families with whom they had faced threats of violence including death.""One of them was accused of eloping with a man"" she told CBS News. ""The man was arrested and killed and we had saved the woman.""Another woman had been sentenced by the Taliban to die by stoning for running off with a man when she was already engaged.""We had to hand over both of them to their families and I don't know what happened to those two women"" Prastish told CBS News.Allegations of Afghan ""child bride"" cases05:22Prastish also doesn't know what became of an eight-year-old girl who had been under the care of her office.

We had to give her to him in the end.""""We were the only source of hope for thousands of women"" Prastish said. ""Now in the absence of Ministry of Women's Affairs they have nowhere to go.""Lost livelihoods lost securityOn August 24 nine days after the Taliban retook control of Kabul spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid formally announced that working women should stay at home — for their safety he said because the group's fighters weren't trained to respect women.But as they grappled with a snowballing humanitarian crisis as most foreign aid money dried up on top of the coronavirus pandemic the country's new rulers soon realized that female nurses and doctors at least were still needed on the job. They were urged to return to work.But for countless other Afghan women and girls many of whom won't even remember the dark days of the Taliban's first reign life has been upended and they have lost far more than careers and income.A group of women hold a street protest calling on the Taliban to protect their rights in Kabul Afghanistan August 17 2021.Shamshad News/via REUTERSMaqsooda lost her job as a university lecturer after the Taliban takeover.

""I lost my only source of income.""Living alone as a woman — something the Taliban would not condone — Maqsooda has other concerns. She found a couple pairs of men's shoes to leave outside her apartment door ""so the Taliban don't find I live alone.""Education under the TalibanOn September 12 the Taliban's acting Minister of Higher Education announced a new policy for female university students. Abdul Baqi Haqqani said women would be allowed to resume their studies but not until they can do so ""according to Islamic principles."" That under the Taliban means not alongside male students.To make that possible Haqqani said universities would have to educate male and female students in separate buildings at different times or partition classrooms and lecture halls. He acknowledged that wouldn't be practical for many universities at least not any time soon so there's no indication when or if women will be allowed to return to Afghanistan's universities.On September 17 the Taliban's Ministry of Education announced the resumption of high school classes across the country after a month-long pause during the chaos of the group's takeover. But the reopening only applies to male students and teachers. There was no mention of female students returning to classes.The announcement was met with national outrage and international criticism.Extended interview: Malala on the future of A...10:08A few months ago Rowanda Abrar an 11th-grade student in Kabul was preparing for her university entrance exam.

""They cannot silence us.""""If girls are not allowed to go back to school this will be a shocking violation of their rights"" said Janti Soeprito president of the Save the Children charity.The Taliban's spokesman Mujahid has insisted that the de-facto ban on education for women and girls is only temporary. He said the Ministry of Education was working to create a safe educational environment for all students but he didn't say when he expected that to happen.Many doubt it ever will as the Taliban barred girls from any formal education during their previous rule.But Abrar born several years after the Taliban was ousted in 2001 isn't prepared to accept that.""They cannot repeat history"" she told CBS News.Protests met with violenceSince the Taliban took Kabul on August 15 scores of Afghan women and rights activists have taken to the city's streets several times demanding their rights and inclusion in the government.

It's often been assumed that it's hard for sharks to differentiate between them but there is little research taking into account how sharks see rather than just from their perspective from underwater.Sharks according to the research have limited color perception if they are not completely color blind and have spatial resolving power that is ""considerably worse than humans.""

"Toronto— Canadians gave Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party a victory in Monday's parliamentary elections but his gamble to win a majority of seats failed.The Liberals were on track to win the most seats of any party. The 49-year-old Trudeau channeled the star power of his father the Liberal icon and late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau when he first won election in 2015 and has led his party to the top finish in two elections since.Trudeau's Liberals were leading or elected in 157 seats - exactly the same number they won in 2019 but 13 short of the 170 needed for a majority in the House of Commons.The Conservatives were leading or elected in 121 seats the same number they won in 2019. The leftist New Democrats were leading or elected in 29 a gain of five seats while the Quebec-based Bloc Québécois was down three at 28 and the Greens remained at two seats.Trudeau didn't win enough seats to avoid having to rely on help from other parties to pass legislation. Trudeau entered the election leading a stable minority government that wasn't under threat of being toppled.The opposition was relentless in accusing Trudeau of calling an unnecessary early vote - two years before the deadline - for his own personal ambition.Canada's Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau greets supporters during the Liberal election night party in Montreal on September 21 2021.Carlos Osorio / REUTERSCOVID takes center stageTrudeau bet Canadians didn't want a Conservative government duringa pandemic. Canada is now among the most fully vaccinated countries in the world. Trudeau's government spent hundreds of billions of dollars to prop up the economy amid lockdowns and he argued that the Conservatives' approach which has been skeptical of lockdowns and vaccine mandates would be dangerous. And he says Canadians need a government that follows science.At an election night party Trudeau told supporters ""You are sending us back to work with a clear mandate to get Canada through this pandemic. I hear you when you say you just want to get back to the things you love and not worry about this pandemic or an election.""Conservative leader Erin O'Toole didn't require his party's candidates to be vaccinated and wouldn't say how many were unvaccinated. O'Toole described vaccination as a personal health decision but a growing number of vaccinated Canadians are increasingly upset with those who refuse to get vaccinated.Trudeau supports making vaccines mandatory for Canadians to travel by air or rail something the Conservatives oppose. And Trudeau has pointed out that Alberta run by a Conservative provincial government is in crisis.Alberta Premier Jason Kenney an ally of O'Toole said the province might run out of beds and staff for intensive care units within days. Kenney apologized for the dire situation and is now reluctantly introducing a vaccine passport and imposing a mandatory work-from-home order two months after lifting nearly all restrictions.Analysts' perspective""Hubris led Trudeau to call the election. He and the Liberals won the election but lost the prize they were seeking. This is only a great night for the Liberals because two weeks ago it appeared they would lose government outright  something they could not fathom before they gambled on an election"" said Nelson Wiseman a political science professor at the University of Toronto.Wiseman said the Conservatives were hurt by the situation in Alberta. ""The explosion of the pandemic in Alberta in the past 10 days undermined O'Toole's compliments of the Alberta Conservatives on how they had handled the pandemic and reinforced Trudeau's argument for mandatory vaccinations"" he said.""Trudeau lost his gamble to get a majority so I would say this is a bittersweet victory for him"" said Daniel Béland a political science professor at McGill University.""Basically we are back to square one as the new minority parliament will look like the previous one. Trudeau and the Liberals saved their skin and will stay in power but many Canadians who didn't want this late summer pandemic elections are probably not amused about the whole situation"" he said.Opposition leader's strategy failsA Conservative win would have represented a rebuke of Trudeau against a politician with a fraction of his name recognition. O'Toole 47 is a military veteran former lawyer and a member of Parliament for nine years.O'Toole advertised himself a year ago as a ""true-blue Conservative."" He became Conservative Party leader with a pledge to ""take back Canada"" but immediately started working to push the party toward the political center.O'Toole's strategy which included disavowing positions held dear by his party's base on issues such as climate change guns and balanced budgets was designed to appeal to a broader cross section of voters in a country that tends to be far more liberal than its southern neighbor.The son of a long-time politician has faced criticism he will say and do anything to get elected.Canada's Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accompanied by his wife Sophie Gregoire and his children Ella-Grace Xavier and Hadrien watch election coverage on TV in Montreal on night of September 20 2021.CARLOS OSORIO / REUTERSWhether moderate Canadians believed O'Toole is the progressive conservative he claims to be and whether he alienated traditional Conservatives became central questions of the campaign.Adrian Archambault a 53-year-old Vancouver resident voted Liberal and said he didn't mind the election was held during a pandemic. He noted provincial elections have also happened during the pandemic.""Everybody has been so preoccupied with COVID the last few years it wasn't maybe a bad thing to sort of do a re-check"" he said.Obama Clinton weighed in but not TrumpTrudeau's legacy includes embracing immigration at a time when the U.S. and other countries closed their doors. He also legalized cannabis nationwide and brought in a carbon tax to fight climate change. And he preserved free trade deal with the U.S. and Mexico amid threats by former U.S. President Donald Trump to scrap the agreement.Former U.S. President Barack Obama and ex-Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton tweeted support for Trudeau. There wasn't a Trump endorsement of O'Toole.Conservative campaign co-chair Walied Soliman said there is no alignment whatsoever between O'Toole and Trumpism. Soliman said earlier in the day holding Trudeau to a minority government would be a win for O'Toole.Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesPablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical adviceSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";Canada's Trudeau re-elected PM but his Liberals don't get majority;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/canada-election-justin-trudeau-prime-minister-liberal-party-parliament-minority/;mindset;0.930000

"United Nations— More than 100 world leaders will attend the United NationsGeneral Assemblyin New York this week. But the centerpiece speeches by presidents and prime ministers were to come after an appeal to younger generations — with the added weight of star-power.In a bid to capture the attention of the world's youth and urge them to play a role in addressing the biggest challenges facing humanity South Korea's President Moon Jae-in invitedK-pop superstars BTSto join him at U.N. headquarters for the General Assembly's World Leaders Week.BTS Special Presidential Envoy for Future Generations and Culture of the Republic of Korea appear at the United Nations on Monday Sept. 20 2021.Cia Pak/UNBTS (Beyond the Scene) aredesignated U.N. youth envoys and they've appeared at previous assemblies. This year's visit by the global music sensations — whose dedicated fans around the planet fall largely into the 15-25-year-old bracket — is aimed at reinvigorating interest in theU.N.'s sustainable development goals or SDGs. The 17 goals were all set with the hope of leaving today's youth with a safer healthier planet to inherit.All seven BTS members attended an event on Monday opened by U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres and President of the U.N. General Assembly Abdulla Shahid. President Moon of South Korea also spoke.To a sparse General Assembly audience and millions of fans around the world via live web stream BTS showed off a new music video on Monday entitled ""Permission to Dance"" which was recorded over the weekend at U.N. headquarters.

Both Guterres and Shahid spoke about the need for the U.N. and its member states to re-commit to meeting the sustainable development goals and they both cited the pandemic as an impeding factor in that work.""It would be easy to lose hope. But we are not hopeless. Or helpless. We have a path to recovery if we choose to take it"" Guterres said.

He is expected to appeal.The 20 other defendants in the case handcuffed and dressed in pale pink prison uniforms were brought to the court for the session.Rusesabagina who used his fame to denounce Rwandan leader Paul Kagame as a dictator has been behind bars since his arrest in August 2020 when a plane he believed was bound for Burundi landed instead in Rwanda's capital Kigali.Rwandan women rebuild country from the ground...02:22His family say Rusesabagina was kidnapped and had rejected the nine charges against him as payback by a vengeful government for his outspoken views.Earlier this month Kagame dismissed criticism of the case saying Rusesabagina was in the dock not because of his fame but over the lives lost ""because of his actions.""Accused of funding terrorThe trial opened in February but the Belgian citizen and US green card holder has boycotted it since March accusing the court of ""unfairness and a lack of independence"".The United States — which awarded Rusesabagina its Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005 — along with the European Parliament and Belgium have been among those to voice concerns about his transfer to Rwanda and the fairness of his trial.Kagame's government accused Rusesabagina of supporting the National Liberation Front (FLN) a rebel group blamed for attacks in 2018 and 2019 that killed nine people.He denied any involvement in the attacks but was a founder of the Rwandan Movement for Democratic Change (MRCD) an opposition group of which the FLN is seen as the armed wing.""MRCD-FLN committed terror acts. MRCD cannot be separated from military acts"" of FLN said judge Mukamurenzi.""The court finds that Rusesabagina's role in founding the FLN provision of funds to the rebels purchase of communication tools for the rebels all constitute the crime of committing terrorism.""During the trial his co-defendants gave conflicting testimony about the level of Rusesabagina's involvement with the FLN and its fighters.""Show trial""Rusesabagina was the former manager of the Hotel des Mille Collines in Kigali where he sheltered hundreds of guests during the genocide that left 800000 people dead mostly ethnic Tutsis.A decade later the American actor Don Cheadle played Rusesabagina a moderate Hutu in the Oscar-nominated blockbuster that brought his story to an international audience.Rusesabagina soon became disillusioned with the new Tutsi-dominated government led by Kagame the rebel leader-turned president whose forces ended the mass killings.Rwandan President Paul Kagame addresses the commemoration of the 20th anniversary of his country's genocide at Amahoro Stadium April 7 2014 in Kigali Rwanda.Chip Somodevilla/GettyHe accused Kagame of authoritarian tendencies and left Rwanda in 1996 living in Belgium and then the United States.Abroad he used his global platform to crusade for political change in Kigali and developed close ties with opposition groups in exile.His family who have campaigned globally for his release say Rusesabagina is a political prisoner and accuse the Rwandan authorities of torturing him in custody.The Hotel Rwanda Foundation which supports Rusesabagina earlier this month described the court proceedings as a ""show trial"" and said the government had failed to provide any credible evidence against him.""Paul's family and team knew that he would be declared 'guilty' the moment he was kidnapped — no trial was needed"" it said.In July meanwhile an international media investigation claimed that Rusesabagina's daughter Carine Kanimba was spied on using Pegasus malware developed by Israeli company NSO.Investigators confirmed that a cell phone belonging to Kanimba a U.S.-Belgian dual national had been compromised multiple times.Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical advicePablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";"""Hotel Rwanda"" boss found guilty of terror crimes by Rwandan court";https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hotel-rwanda-paul-rusesabagina-guilty-terror-crimes-paul-kagame/;mindset;0.930000
"Moscow —A gunman opened fire on a Russian university campus on Monday killing at least six people investigators said in the country's second mass shooting this year to target students. Videos circulating on social media showed people throwing belongings from windows of university buildings in the central city of Perm before jumping to flee the shooter.The Investigative Committee which probes major crimes said several people were injured in the attack at Perm State National Research University and that the suspect a student at the university had been wounded while being detained. The committee initially put the death toll at eight but later revised it down to six.Police block the road near the scene after a gunman opened fire at the Perm State University in Perm Russia September 20 2021.STRINGER/REUTERSState media broadcast amateur footage reportedly taken during the attack showing an individual dressed in black tactical clothing including a helmet carrying a weapon and walking through the campus.In a statement carried by Russian news agencies the health ministry said 24 people were receiving treatment including 19 who had received gunshot wounds. The health ministry declined to comment when reached by AFP.""On September 20 a student who was on the territory of one of the buildings of Perm State National Research University opened fire on those around him"" the Investigative Committee said in a statement.Students react as they gather outside the Perm State University in Perm about 700 miles east of Moscow Russia September 20 2021.APSchool shootings are relatively unusual in Russia due to tight security at education facilities and because it is difficult to buy firearms legally although it is possible to register hunting rifles.President Vladimir Putin had been notified of the shooting the Kremlin said adding that the health and science ministers had been ordered to travel to Perm to coordinate assistance for the victims.""The president expresses sincere condolences to those who have lost family and loved ones as a result of this incident"" Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.Regional authorities said that classes at local schools colleges and universities were cancelled on Monday.Russia's last deadly attack at an educational facility took place in May 2021 when a 19-year-old opened fire in his old school in the central city of Kazankilling nine people.Investigators said that the gunman suffered from a brain disorder. But he was deemed fit to receive a license for the semi-automatic shotgun he used in the attack.On the day of that attack — one of the worst in recent Russian history — Putin called for a review of gun control laws.In November 2019 a 19-year-old student in the far eastern town of Blagoveshchensk opened fire at his college killing one classmate and injuring three other people before shooting and killing himself.In October 2018 another teenage gunman killed 20 people at a Kerch technical college in Crimea the peninsula Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.He was shown in camera footage wearing a similar T-shirt to Eric Harris one of the killers in the 1999 Columbine High School shooting in the United States which left 13 people dead.The Crimea shooter was able to legally obtain a gun licence after undergoing marksmanship training and being examined by a psychiatrist.The country's FSB security service says it has prevented dozens of armed attacks on schools in recent years.The shooting took place as Russia was counting ballots following three-day parliamentary and local elections.Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical advicePablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";At least 6 killed in mass shooting on Russian university campus;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-shooting-perm-university-student-deaths-2021-09-20/;mindset;0.930000

"Great white shark attacks are rare and when they do occur they are sometimes fatal. But attacks against the human species are often a result of mistaken identity new research published on Tuesday shows.Thestudy published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface was conducted by looking at humans and animals from a great white shark's eye view below the ocean surface. It's often been assumed that it's hard for sharks to differentiate between them but there is little research taking into account how sharks see rather than just from their perspective from underwater.Sharks according to the research have limited color perception if they are not completely color blind and have spatial resolving power that is ""considerably worse than humans."" So when they are looking for prey researchers found they more heavily rely on motion and brightness contrast.To determine how great white sharks primarily juveniles since they are most often the ones involved in human interactions might see objects when looking up from below the ocean surface researchers specifically compared video footage of rectangular floats humans swimming humans paddling surfboards and pinnipeds including sea lions and seals. The footage was filtered to mimic the sharks' visual system.And as it turns out the researchers found that juvenile great whites cannot significantly differentiate between the different life forms.

""The question is ... the forces present the balance in the Indo-Pacific where part of our future is at play and our relations with China.""The deal by the U.S. reflects the American pivot toward the Indo-Pacific region seen as increasingly strategic as China bolsters its influence there.

""There was a moment of shock of anger ... Now we must advance.""On Friday night Le Drian railed against what France views as a betrayal marked by ""duplicity disdain and lies"" in the submarine affair.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Sunday that France ""would have had every reason to know that we have deep and grave concerns"" about the capability of France's Attack class subs which he said can't meet Australia's strategic interests.Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical advicePablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";"French president to talk to Biden amid ""grave crisis"" over submarines";https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/macron-biden-diplmoatic-crisis-submarine-deal-australia/;mindset;0.930000

"Sorry is not enough for the Afghan survivors of an errantU.S. drone strikethat killed 10 members of their family including seven children.Emal Ahmadi whose 3-year-old daughter Malika was killed on August 29 when the U.S. hellfire missile struck his elder brother's car told The Associated Press on Saturday that the family demands Washington investigate who fired the drone and punish the military personnel responsible for the strike.""That is not enough for us to say sorry"" said Ahmadi. ""The U.S.A. should find the person who did this.""Ahmadi said the family is also seeking financial compensation for their losses and demanded that several members of the family be relocated to a third country without specifying which country.The AP and other news organizations in Kabul reported after the strike that the driver of the targeted vehicle Zemerai Ahmadi was a longtime employee at an American humanitarian organization and cited an absence of evidence to support the Pentagon's assertion that the vehicle contained explosives.The missile struck as the car was pulling into the family's driveway and the children ran to greet Zemerai.On Friday U.S. Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie head of U.S. Central Command called  the strike a ""tragic mistake""  and after weeks of denials said that innocent civilians were indeed killed in the attack and not an Islamic State extremist as was announced earlier.The drone strike followed a devastating suicide bombing by the Islamic State group — a rival of the Taliban — that killed 169 Afghans and 13 U.S. military personnel at one of the gates to the Kabul airport. For days desperate Afghans had swarmed the checkpoints outside the airport trying to leave the country amid the chaotic U.S. and NATO troops pullout fearing for their future under the Taliban.McKenzie apologized for the error and said the United States is considering making reparation payments to the family of the victims.Emal Ahmadi who said he heard of the apology from friends in America insisted that it won't bring back members of his family and while he expressed relief for the U.S. apology and recognition that his family were innocent victims he said he was frustrated that it took weeks of pleading with Washington to at least make a call to the family.Even as evidence mounted to the contrary Pentagon officials asserted that the strike had been conducted correctly to protect the U.S. troops remaining at Kabul's airport ahead of the final pullout the following day on August 30.Looking exhausted sitting in front of the charred ruins of Zemarai's car Ahmadi said he wanted more than an apology form the United States — he wanted justice including an investigation into who carried out the strike ""and I want him punished by the U.S.A.""Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical advicePablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";"Afghan survivors of U.S. drone strike: Sorry ""is not enough""";https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/afghan-survivors-of-us-drone-strike-sorry-is-not-enough/;mindset;0.930000
"United Nations— The Biden administration worries that this year'sU.N. General Assemblycould become a COVID-19 ""superspreader event"" as world leaders descend on New York City without necessarily abiding by localvaccine requirements. On Friday President Biden's U.N. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told CBS News at a press conference ""We are concerned about the U.N. event being a superspreader event and that we need to take all measures to ensure that it does not become a superspreader event.""Unlike last year whenCOVID-19pandemic forced the largest annual gathering of world leaders to go virtual this year a hybrid format means that heads of state can either send in a video or appear in person.Despite a note from Thomas-Greenfield urging diplomats to send in videos more than 100 presidents prime ministers and others are set to give in-person speeches at the two-week event.

General Assembly Hall qualifies as a convention center"" the letter said.Shahid wrote to all U.N. member states ""strongly"" supporting the measure and pledging to implement it. But then in a diplomatic accommodation Shahid sent a newletterThursday saying  ""I would like to advise delegations that the honour system related to vaccinations … remains in place.""The decision to invoke the ""honour system"" came after Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia weighed in saying he was ""surprised and disappointed"" by the idea of requiring proof of vaccination to enter the General Assembly Hall. Nebenzia called it ""discriminatory"" and contrary to the 1947 agreement between the U.S. and the U.N. that establishes the world body's international status.Asked about the Russian opposition to the requirement on Thursday at his press conference the mayor was defiant.""My simple statement to begin is if the Russian ambassador is against it I'm for it"" de Blasio said.""I spoke to Secretary General Guterres two weeks ago and we had a very good conversation. He's been outstanding in trying to push the highest health standards for the General Assembly"" de Blasio said adding ""We understand the United Nations is a particular organization has its own rules and its own jurisdiction.""The honor system the Secretary General's spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said Friday  means that ""by swiping a badge to enter the General Assembly Hall delegates attest that they are fully vaccinated that they have not tested positive for COVID‑19 in the last 10 days [and] have no symptoms.""The mayor also announced that the city would be opening a pop-up testing and vaccination site at U.N. headquarters to provide free COVID-19 tests as well as the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine.Thomas-Greenfield said she'll be getting a test there herself Monday morning.Asked by CBS News about the risk of so many people coming into New York from so many countries she said ""Leaders have to be responsible and they have to take responsibility for their actions and ensure that their actions do not lead to jeopardizing the health and safety of the people of New York of all of the participants here at the United Nations and that they don't take COVID back to their home countries.""The General Assembly meeting comes after a rough year at U.N.

"A U.S. drone strike launched in Afghanistan late last month killed as many as 10 civilians and not an ISIS-K terrorist as the U.S. military previously reported the Pentagon acknowleged Friday. General Frank McKenzie the commander of the U.S. Central Command called the strike ""a tragic mistake"" during a news conference Friday afternoon.An investigation by Central Command determined that theAugust 29 strikein Kabul which Joint Chief Chairman General Mark Milley previously described as a ""righteous strike"" killed an innocent aid worker — identified by friends and colleagues as Zemerai Ahmadi — and as many as nine of his family members including up to seven children.A view of the damage at Zemerai Ahmadi's family house after a drone strike one day before the final U.S. evacuation flights from Kabul Afghanistan. Ahmadi and nine members of his family including seven children were reported killed in the airstrike on August 29 2021.Haroon Sabawoon/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images""We now assess that it is unlikely that the vehicle and those who died were associated with ISIS-K or were a direct threat to U.S. forces"" McKenzie said. ""I offer my profound condolences to the family and friends of those who were killed.""McKenzie said the United States is considering making reparation payments to the family of the victims.U.S. intelligence reportedly followed the car Ahmadi was driving for eight hours because it had been observed at a compound associated with theterrorist group known as ISIS-K. During that time the movements of the car corresponded to other intelligence about ISIS plans for an attack on the airport McKenzie said.The strike was conducted as Ahmadi pulled into the driveway of his home which was located about 3 kilometers from the airport.The drone strike set off a large secondary explosion which officials originally said was evidence that the car was indeed carrying explosives but which the investigation determined was most likely set off by a propane tank located in the driveway McKenzie said.""I am here today to set the record straight and acknowledge our mistakes"" the commander said Friday.Pentagon: Drone strike was ""tragic mistake""15:48Milley responded to the investigation's findings.""In a dynamic high threat environment the commanders on the ground had appropriate authority and had reasonable certainty that the target was valid but after deeper post strike analysis our conclusion is that innocent civilians were killed"" he said in a statement to CBS News Friday evening. ""This is a horrible tragedy of war and its heart wrenching and we are committed to being fully transparent about this incident.""Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin also issued a statement Friday following McKenzie's announcement.""On behalf of the men and women of the Department of Defense I offer my deepest condolences to surviving family members of those who were killed including Mr. Ahmadi and to the staff of Nutrition and Education International Mr. Ahmadi's employer"" he said.Austin also announced a review of the U.S. Central Command's investigation.""I have asked for this review to consider the degree to which the investigation considered all available context and information the degree to which accountability measures need to be taken and at what level and the degree to which strike authorities procedures and processes need to be altered in the future"" he said.The Pentagon's acknowledgement came a week after aNew York Times investigationexposed detailed evidence showing Ahmadi was wrongly targeted.Afghanistan: The New RealityMoreISIS-K could be able to launch attacks out of Afghanistan within a year: DOD officialHumanitarian crisis surges under Taliban ruleFormer chief negotiator for U.S. Zalmay Khalilzad sticks by his Taliban dealAmericans in Afghanistan face hard choice of dividing their familiesAfghan girls determined to return to schoolMoreDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";U.S. drone strike in Afghanistan killed as many as 10 civilians;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/afghanistan-drone-strike-mistake-civilians-killed-pentagon/;mindset;0.930000

"Beijing— A trio of Chinese astronauts returned to Earth on Friday after a 90-day stay aboard their nation's first space station in China's longest mission yet.Nie Haisheng Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo landed in the Shenzhou-12 spaceship just after 1:30 p.m. local time (1:30 a.m. EDT Friday) after having undocked from the space station Thursday morning.State broadcaster CCTV showed footage of the spacecraft parachuting to land in the Gobi Desertwhere it was met by helicopters and off-road vehicles. Minutes later a crew of technicians began opening the hatch of the capsule which appeared undamaged.The three astronauts emerged about 30 minutes later and were seated in reclining chairs just outside the capsule to allow them time to readjust to Earth's gravity after three months of living in a weightless environment. The three were due to fly to Beijing on Friday.In photo released by Xinhua News Agency Chinese astronauts from left Tang Hongbo Nie Haisheng and Liu Boming wave at the Dongfeng landing site in the Gobi Desert on September 17 2021. The trio of Chinese astronauts returned to Earth after a 90-day stay aboard their nation's first space station in China's longest mission yet.Xinhua News Agency / Ju Zhenhua / AP""With China's growing strength and the rising level of Chinese technology I firmly believe there will even more astronauts who will set new records"" mission commander Nie told CCTV.After launching on June 17 the three astronauts went on two spacewalks deployed a 33-foot mechanical arm and had a video call with Communist Party leader Xi Jinping.While few details have been made public by China's military which runs the space program astronaut trios are expected to be brought on 90-day missions to the station over the next two years to make it fully functional.The government hasn't announced the names of the next set of astronauts nor the launch date of Shenzhou-13.China has sent 14 astronauts into space since 2003 when it became only the third country after the former Soviet Union and the United States to do so on its own.A giant screen shows a news broadcast in Beijing of the astronauts on the Shenzhou-12 mission inside the core module Tianhe of the Chinese space station on September 16 2021 before they returned to Earth the next day after a 90 day mission.TINGSHU WANG / REUTERSChina's space program has advanced at a measured pace and has largely avoided many of the problems that marked the U.S. and Russian programs that were locked in intense competition during the heady early days of spaceflight.That's made it a source of enormous national pride complementing the country's rise to economic technological military and diplomatic prominence in recent years under the firm rule of the Communist Party and current leader Xi Jinping.China embarked on its own space station program in the 1990s after being excluded from the International Space Station largely due to U.S. objections to the Chinese space program's secrecy and military backing.China has simultaneously pushed ahead with uncrewed missions placing a rover on the little-explored far side of the moon and in December the Chang'e 5 probe returned lunar rocks to Earth for the first time since the 1970s.China this year also landed its Tianwen-1 space probe on Mars with its accompanying Zhurong rover venturing out to look for evidence of life.Another program calls for collecting samples from an asteroid an area in which Japan's rival space program has made progress of late.China also plans to dispatch another mission in 2024 to bring back lunar samples and is pursuing a possible crewed mission to the moon and eventually building a scientific base there although no timeline has been proposed for such projects.

"Great white shark attacks are rare and when they do occur they are sometimes fatal. But attacks against the human species are often a result of mistaken identity new research published on Tuesday shows.Thestudy published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface was conducted by looking at humans and animals from a great white shark's eye view below the ocean surface. It's often been assumed that it's hard for sharks to differentiate between them but there is little research taking into account how sharks see rather than just from their perspective from underwater.Sharks according to the research have limited color perception if they are not completely color blind and have spatial resolving power that is ""considerably worse than humans."" So when they are looking for prey researchers found they more heavily rely on motion and brightness contrast.To determine how great white sharks primarily juveniles since they are most often the ones involved in human interactions might see objects when looking up from below the ocean surface researchers specifically compared video footage of rectangular floats humans swimming humans paddling surfboards and pinnipeds including sea lions and seals. The footage was filtered to mimic the sharks' visual system.And as it turns out the researchers found that juvenile great whites cannot significantly differentiate between the different life forms. The silhouettes of the different objects at the surface are too similar for the animals given their reliance on motion and light.""From the perspective of a white shark...neither visual motion nor shape cues allow an unequivocal visual distinction between pinnipeds and humans"" the study says ""supporting the mistaken identity theory behind some bites.""Laura Ryan the lead author of the study said in apress releasefrom Macquarie University that surfers are the most at-risk for fatal shark bites particularly from juveniles.""We found that surfers swimmers and pinnipeds (seals and sea lions) on the surface of the ocean will look the same to a white shark looking up from below because these sharks can't see fine details or colours"" she said.Professor Nathan Hart senior author of the study said thatgreat whiteshave to learn what to eat and their diet changes as they grow and learn. This could explain why juvenile sharks tend to be more commonly involved in biting humans. Adult sharks researchers said tend to have better vision and can better differentiate.""They need to develop a search image for these prey items and combine that with other sensory information"" Hart said. ""It's a learning process that could be prone to mistakes.""The study was also conducted in a controlled pool setting rather than the ocean leading researchers to believe that the sharks' ability to differentiate between humans and prey is actually worse because of the lower visibility in oceans. They also believe that the mistaken identity theory could apply to other shark species associated with human fatalities such as tiger sharks or bull sharks.But researchers also urged people to remember that shark bites are rare. In 2020 there were 57 confirmed unprovokedshark attack casesworldwide according to the University of Florida's International Shark Attack File. The 2015 to 2019 average was 80 incidents every year.They also reiterated that sharks themselves are endangered. In January scientists announced that shark and ray populations havedeclined more than 70%over the past 50 years with overfishing being a main culprit. Fish nets and drum lines often placed under water to ward off the animals only further threaten the species and other marine life researchers of the great white study found.They hope their findings can help find better ways to prevent future shark bites and provide an overall better understanding of the creatures that are vital to marine ecosystems.""Understanding why shark bites occur can help us find ways to prevent them"" Ryan said ""while keeping both humans and sharks safer.""Direction and strength of motion cues from the 2DMD model of (a–c) a pinniped swimming (d–f) a human paddling a surfboard (g–i) a human swimming and (j–l) a rectangular float towed through the water. Modelling was performed assuming a spatial resolving power of either 5 cpd (behk) or 2.5 cpd (cfil). Red open dots indicate angle vectors that were significantly different from the pinniped and black dots were not significantly different. Units are an arbitrary scaling value. Dashed lines on (a) show the division of the object for analysis of the different 'faces'.

They also believe that the mistaken identity theory could apply to other shark species associated with human fatalities such as tiger sharks or bull sharks.But researchers also urged people to remember that shark bites are rare. In 2020 there were 57 confirmed unprovokedshark attack casesworldwide according to the University of Florida's International Shark Attack File. The 2015 to 2019 average was 80 incidents every year.They also reiterated that sharks themselves are endangered. In January scientists announced that shark and ray populations havedeclined more than 70%over the past 50 years with overfishing being a main culprit. Fish nets and drum lines often placed under water to ward off the animals only further threaten the species and other marine life researchers of the great white study found.They hope their findings can help find better ways to prevent future shark bites and provide an overall better understanding of the creatures that are vital to marine ecosystems.""Understanding why shark bites occur can help us find ways to prevent them"" Ryan said ""while keeping both humans and sharks safer.""Direction and strength of motion cues from the 2DMD model of (a–c) a pinniped swimming (d–f) a human paddling a surfboard (g–i) a human swimming and (j–l) a rectangular float towed through the water.

"A recentreportfrom the United Nations found that the world risks soon hitting 1.5°C of global warming in the 2030s a threshold that would ignite ""extreme events unprecedented in the observational record."" Despite the dire warning a new analysis has found that none of the world's major economic countries have sufficient plans to combat climate change.The goal of the Paris Climate Agreement is to maintain that 1.5 threshold. But last month's report said that without ""deep reductions in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions"" the world will surpass it within 80 years.If dramatic reductions were made quickly it would put the world closer to that goal; however experts have said that such a scenario is unlikely. And Wednesday's analysis of 37 countries by watchdog organization Climate Action Tracker (CAT) seems to echo that assessment.""While people are suffering from ever more severe and frequent impacts of climate change around the globe and the IPCC has yet again clearly demonstrated the feasibility and urgency of climate change mitigation action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions continues to lag behind what is needed – in practically all countries and sectors"" the report says. ""The momentum on updating 2030 targets for climate action has stalled since May with no major emitters putting forward stronger climate targets and the 2030 emissions gap has barely changed.""The majority of G20 countries which includes 19 countries and the European Union and make up more than 80% of the world's GDP and 60% of the global population have failed to met their obligations the analysis found.Only Gambia has a plan ""compatible"" with the Paris agreement CAT said and the United Kingdom is the only one of the G20 countries among those with ""almost sufficient"" plans. CAT determined its rankings based on countries' mitigation targets policies and action and climate action.Climate Action Tracker's overall analysis of how well countries are working to meet their climate targets as part of the Paris Climate Agreement.Climate Action TrackerTwo G20 countries had ""critically insufficient"" plans; nine had ""highly insufficient"" plans; and four including the U.S. had ""insufficient"" plans. Three G20 countries  France Italy and Turkey  were not included in the analysis asCAT saysthey have not provided new submissions for their plans.President Biden said in May at theLeaders Climate Summitthat the U.S. will cut greenhouse gas emission by at least half from 2005 levels by 2030. Niklas Höhne of NewClimate Institute said that groups thought it seemed as though dialogue at the summit created ""good momentum.""""But since then there has been little to no improvement: nothing is moving"" Höhne said in astatement. ""Governments have now closed the gap by up to 15% a minimal improvement since May.

Wednesday's analysis found that gap has only been narrowed by about 15% according to the NDC updates countries have submitted so far.Nearly 90 countries as well as the EU have submitted new updates covering half of global greenhouse emissions CAT said. Some countries have proposed new and ambitious targets but have not formally submitted them. More than 70 countries accounting for roughly 25% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions have yet to submit any goals at all.Australia Brazil Indonesia Mexico New Zealand Russia Singapore Switzerland and Vietnam governments are ""of particular concern"" CAT said as they ""have failed to lift ambition at all."" The watchdog says these countries have submitted either the same or even less ambitious goals for their 2030 targets than what they had proposed in 2015.The group said that while the U.S. EU and Germany have significantly updated their targets and implemented new polices ""positive developments need to urgently be scaled up"" by others. CAT said that ""almost all developed countries"" need to strengthen their targets as fast as possible and to support developing countries to do the same.""The most important target date is 2030 by which time global emissions must be cut by 50% and governments are nowhere near this"" the group said.

"A conservation group's account of more than 1400 dolphins being slaughtered over the weekend in the remote Faroe Islands has drawn a huge outcry online. Hunting for sea mammals is a common and regulated practice in the islands which are a self-governing region of Denmark but a government official says a ""big mistake"" led to the killing of far more animals than expected.Sea Shepard Global an international ocean conservation group reported that on Sunday night a super-pod of 1428 Atlantic white-sided dolphins were killed off the Faroe Islands. The activists said hunters used speed boats and jet-skis to drive the dolphins into shallow water where they were killed.On Sunday night a super-pod of 1428 Atlantic White-Sided Dolphins was driven for many hours and for around 45 km by speed boats and jet-skis into the shallow water at Skálabotnur beach in the Danish Faroe Islands where every single one of them was killed.https://t.co/uo2fAPhCDq— Sea Shepherd (@seashepherd)September 14 2021Olavur Sjurdarberg chairman of the Faroese Whalers Association confirmed the killings to theBBC saying that while the number of dolphins killed was excessive it was accidental.""It was a big mistake"" he told the BBC. ""When the pod was found they estimated it to be only 200 dolphins.""Japan's dolphin hunt town defiant after setbackSjurdarberg said hunters did not know the size of the pod until after they started killing but that ""somebody should have known better.""He said the hunt had been authorized by Faroese authorities contradicting claims by Sea Shepard that the proper officials were ""never informed and therefore never authorized the hunt."" The activist group also said that many participants of the hunt did not have a license.Faroe Islands media outletKringvarp Føroyasaid 500 people and 50 boats had signed up to be a part of the hunt.The Faroese government put out astatementon Thursday that it will be evaluating the ""extraordinary"" hunt as it ""has raised some issues.""The pod of dolphins captured in the hunt is the largest in Faroe Island history. A government spokesperson told CBS news that the largest catch prior to Sunday was in 1988 when 544 white-sided dolphins were killed.While pilot whale hunting known as the ""grind"" is an ""ancient and integral part of Faroese food culture"" the government said that pilot whales and dolphins are different and dolphins ""do not have the same cultural legitimacy.""""We take this matter very seriously. Although these hunts are considered sustainable we will be looking closely at the dolphin hunts and what part they should play in Faroese society"" Prime Minister Bárður á Steig Nielsen said. ""The government has decided to start an evaluation of the regulations on the catching of Atlantic white-sided dolphins.""Obtaining a license to hunt sea mammals in the islands requires specific training on how hunters are supposed to kill their catches to abide by animal welfare legislation. Videos of the hunt posted by Sea Shepard show many of the dolphins were still moving after being placed on shore alongside dead animals.Faroe Islands Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Culture told CBS News that the hunt was organized and carried out in accordance with the law. The district administrator was informed about the pod sighting and whaling foremen organized and oversaw the hunt a spokesperson for the ministry said.""There were no breaches of law and regulations.""Supporters of an annual dolphin hunt in weste...01:56The hunting of dolphins and whales has been common in the islands since the time of the Vikings. Whale drives which can be authorized at any time of year are meant to provide food and are ""fully regulated by law and regulations"" thegovernmentsays.

"Seoul South Korea—North Koreafired two ballistic missiles into waters off its eastern coast on Wednesday afternoon two days after claiming to havetested a new long-range cruise missilein a resumption of its weapons displays after a six-month lull. South Korea responded to the latest provocation with landmark weapons tests of its own just hours later ratcheting up tension on the nuclear-armed Korean Peninsula where thousands of American troops are based.South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the North launched the two missiles on Wednesday from a site in the center of the country.Hours later South Korea said it had successfully carried out a first-ever test of an underwater-launched missile making the country one of just seven in the world with the proven capability to fire a ballistic missile from a submarine along with the U.S. Russia China Britain France and India.An image from video released by South Korea's Ministry of Defense on September 15 2021 shows the submarine used in the country's first-ever test firing of an underwater-launched missile.Handout/South Korean Ministry of DefenseSouth Korea's Agency for Defense Development also announced in a statement that the country had tested on Wednesday a new fighter-jet launched long range air-to-surface missile and it touted development of a new supersonic missile with ""a higher speed than existing missiles making it very difficult for enemy ships to respond which further improves the missile's survivability and destructive power.""The agency said that new missile was ""expected to become a core force that can more effectively respond to forces approaching Korea's territorial waters.""President Moon Jae-in's office said in a statement that Moon had observed the test of a domestically built submarine-launched ballistic missile on Wednesday afternoon. It said the missile flew a previously set distance and hit a designated target.Video released by the South Korean Ministry of Defense showed a submarine sailing at the surface and then cut to a clip that showed a missile emerging from beneath the sea and flying skyward.An image from video released by South Korea's Ministry of Defense on September 15 2021 shows the country's first-ever test of an underwater-launched missile from a submarine.Handout/South Korean Ministry of DefenseAfter Moon lauded the South's growing missile capabilities as ""sure deterrence"" against future North Korean provocations the powerful sister of North Korea's leader threatened a ""complete destruction"" of relations between the two countries.Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said earlier that the North Korean missiles had landed outside of Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone in waters between northwest Japan and the Korean Peninsula.""Deeply troubling"" resumption of work at N. Korean reactorNorth Korea's latest tests ""threaten the peace and safety of Japan and the region and are absolutely outrageous"" Suga said. ""The government of Japan is determined to further step up our vigilance and surveillance to be prepared for any contingencies.""The U.S. military's Indo-Pacific Command said in a statement that it was ""aware of the missile launch"" by North Korea and was ""consulting closely with our allies and partners.""""While we have assessed that this event does not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel or territory or to our allies the missile launch highlights the destabilizing impact of the DPRK's [North Korea's] illicit weapons program. The U.S. commitment to the defense of the Republic of Korea [South Korea] and Japan remains ironclad"" the statement said.There was no immediate U.S. statement on South Korea's submarine-fired missile test but the two — countries coordinate closely and America has maintained a robust troop presence in the South  approximately 30000 personnel — since hostilities in the Korean War ended without a treaty in the 1950s.Activity seen at North Korea nuclear reactor00:35Seoul said South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities were analyzing details about the North Korean launches.The South Korean joint chiefs' statement added that the South had boosted its anti-North Korea surveillance posture. The statement was released prior to the announcement of South Korea's own missile test on Wednesday.North Korea had said Monday that it tested a newly developed cruise missile twice over the weekend. North Korean state media described the missile as a ""strategic weapon of great significance"" implying they were developed with the intent to arm them with nuclear warheads.According to North Korean accounts the missile flew about 930 miles a distance putting all of Japan — including U.S. military installations in that country — within reach.Many experts say the weekend tests suggest that North Korea is pushing to bolster its weapons arsenal amid a deadlock in nuclear diplomacy between Pyongyang and Washington.Wednesday's launches came as Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi was in Seoul for meetings with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and other senior officials to discuss the stalled nuclear diplomacy with the North.It's unusual for North Korea to make provocative launches when China its last major ally and biggest aid provider is engaged in a major diplomatic event.Moon's office said Moon told Wang he appreciates China's role in the international diplomatic push to resolve the North Korean nuclear standoff and asked for Beijing's continuing support.Wang said Beijing will continue to support the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and improved ties between the Koreas and also called for further development in relations with Seoul.Biden holds press conference with South Korea...10:30The nuclear diplomacy between the United States and North Korea has stalled since 2019 when the Americans rejected the North's demand for major sanctions relief in exchange for dismantling an aging nuclear facility. Kim's government has so far threatened to build high-tech weapons targeting the United States and rejected the Biden administration's overtures for dialogue demanding that Washington abandon its ""hostile"" policies first.The North's resumption of testing activity is likely an attempt at pressuring the Biden administration over the diplomatic freeze after Kim failed to leverage his arsenal for economic benefits during the presidency of Donald Trump.North Korea ended a yearlong pause in ballistic tests in March by firing two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea continuing a tradition of testing new U.S. administrations with weapons demonstrations aimed at measuring Washington's response and wresting concessions.North Korea still maintains a self-imposed moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests a sign that it may not want to completely scuttle the nuclear negotiations with the United States.North KoreaMoreSouth Korea has partial success with 1st launch into the space raceNorth Korea confirms test of missile designed for submarine launchN.

"The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) executive committee announced on Tuesday it will review cannabis' status as a banned substance. The announcement came two months after U.S. sprinting star Sha'Carri Richardson was disqualified from the Tokyo Olympics for using marijuana after she had learned that her mother died.WADA said in astatementthat the review was prompted after the agency received requests from ""a number of stakeholders."" The scientific review of cannabis will be initiated in 2022 the agency said and will be conducted by the agency's Prohibited List Expert Advisory Group.Until any change of its status is confirmed cannabis will continue to be prohibited in competition through at least 2022.Natural and synthetic cannabinoids including cannabis areprohibited in-competition meaning anytime from just before midnight the day before a competition until after the competition and the sample collection process. Cannabidiol (CBD) is the only cannabinoid permitted in-competition.A2011 paperfrom the WADA published in the journal Sport Medicine said that marijuana is banned because athletes who smoke cannabis ""could potentially endanger themselves and others because of increased risk taking slower reaction times and poor executive function or decision making."" The agency also said that the substance can be ""performance enhancing for some athletes"" and that using it is ""not consistent with the athlete as a role model for young people.""However not all studies on the matter have come to this conclusion.A 2018 study published in the Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine found that there ""is no direct evidence of performance-enhancing effects in athletes.""""The potential beneficial effects of cannabis as part of a pain management protocol including reducing concussion-related symptoms deserve further attention"" the paper said.The agency's announcement comes in the controversial wake of 21-year-oldSha'Carri Richardson being disqualifiedfrom the Olympics for using marijuana during the Olympic trials. Recreational marijuana is legal in Oregon where the trials were held but the substance is prohibited in her sport.Following the news of her positive test Richardson told ""Today"" she used the substance after learning from a reporter that her biological mom had died. The news she said ""sent me in a state of emotional panic.""Richardson's disqualification from Tokyo sparked outrage over the summer with many saying that her use of the substance should not have diminished her chance to compete. During thetrials Richardson won the 100m clocking the run at 10.86 seconds. Months earlier she had clocked in the distance at 10.72.

"Beijing— A Chinese court has thrown out a lawsuit brought by a woman who claims she was sexually harassed as an intern by a major television personality in the country dealing a blow to a#MeToo movementthat has struggled to gain momentum inChina.In a statement posted online the Haidian People's Court in Beijing said it dismissed the case filed by former intern Zhou Xiaoxuan who claimed she was sexually harassed in 2014 by talk show host Zhu Jun — a household name in China.Leading figure in China's #MeToo movement Zhou Xiaoxuan left is comforted after being accosted by unknown people while speaking to journalists and supporters outside the Haidian District People's Court before a hearing in her case against prominent television host Zhu Jun on September 14 2021 in Beijing China.Kevin Frayer/GettyThe court dismissed the case brought by Zhou who's now 28 saying the evidence submitted by her legal team had failed to prove that any harassment occurred Zhou told CBS News on Wednesday. She said she planned to appeal the decision.Zhou first levelled the allegations against Zhu in a series of social media posts by herself and her friends in 2018 giving details of her alleged experience during an internship at state television network CCTV where Zhu was her superior.Why saying ""Me Too"" can be risky for women in JapanZhou claimed that the celebrity interviewer who's known for bringing stars to tears on his set groped and forcibly kissed her.The posts quickly went viral on Chinese social media sites but they were soon taken down by government censors.Leading figure in China's #MeToo movement Zhou Xiaoxuan right waits as her identification is checked by police before entering the Haidian District People's Court for a hearing in her case against prominent television host Zhu Jun September 14 2021 in Beijing China.Kevin Frayer/GettyWeeks later Zhu denied the accusations made by Zhou and filed a lawsuit against her in a Beijing court claiming defamation. Zhou then filed her lawsuit against Zhu formally alleging harassment. She is seeking a public apology and damages of 50000 yuan ($7600).The first hearing in the case wasn't held until December 2020 behind closed doors.The long-running high-profile legal battle and the constant censorship of her social media content made Zhou a symbol of China's #MeToo movement.But she and her supporters have seen their content quickly removed from Chinese social media platforms and protests have been quickly broken up.An unidentified man grabs a small protest sign reading ""stand together"" from the hands of a supporter of leading figure in China's #MeToo movement Zhou Xiaoxuan outside the Haidian District People's Court before a hearing in her case against prominent television host Zhu Jun on September 14 2021 in Beijing China.Kevin Frayer/GettySeveral other harassment and rape cases have drawn attention to the issue of women's safety in China in recent months.Chinese-Canadian singer Kris Wu was arrested in August by Beijing police on suspicion of rape and a former manager with Chinese tech giant Alibaba was accused of rape by a co-worker.

"Great white shark attacks are rare and when they do occur they are sometimes fatal. But attacks against the human species are often a result of mistaken identity new research published on Tuesday shows.Thestudy published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface was conducted by looking at humans and animals from a great white shark's eye view below the ocean surface. It's often been assumed that it's hard for sharks to differentiate between them but there is little research taking into account how sharks see rather than just from their perspective from underwater.Sharks according to the research have limited color perception if they are not completely color blind and have spatial resolving power that is ""considerably worse than humans."" So when they are looking for prey researchers found they more heavily rely on motion and brightness contrast.To determine how great white sharks primarily juveniles since they are most often the ones involved in human interactions might see objects when looking up from below the ocean surface researchers specifically compared video footage of rectangular floats humans swimming humans paddling surfboards and pinnipeds including sea lions and seals. The footage was filtered to mimic the sharks' visual system.And as it turns out the researchers found that juvenile great whites cannot significantly differentiate between the different life forms.

"German authorities have compensated nearly 250 people who were prosecuted or investigated under a Nazi-era law criminalizing homosexuality that continued to be enforced enthusiastically after World War II.The Federal Office of Justice said Monday that up to the end of August 317 people had applied for compensation and it had been paid out in 249 cases. So far it has paid out nearly 860000 euros (just over $1 million).Fourteen applications are still being processed 18 were rejected and 36 were withdrawn the office said. The deadline for applications is July 21 next year.German lawmakers in 2017 approved the annulment of thousands of convictions under the Paragraph 175 law which remained in force in West Germany in its Nazi-era form until homosexuality was decriminalized in 1969. They cleared the way for payments of 3000 euros per conviction plus 1500 euros for every year of jail time those convicted started.The German justice minister Heiko Maas (SPD) at the memorial for the homosexual victims of National Socialist persecution in Berlin Germany 28 April 2017.Michael KappelerIn 2019 the government extended compensation to people who were put under investigation or taken into investigative custody but not convicted. It offered payments of 500 euros per investigation opened 1500 euros for each year of time in pre-trial custody started and 1500 euros for other professional financial or health disadvantages related to the law.The law criminalizing male homosexuality was introduced in the 19th century toughened under Nazi rule and retained in that form by democratic West Germany which convicted some 50000 men between 1949 and 1969.Homosexuality was decriminalized in 1969 but the legislation wasn't taken off the books entirely until 1994.In 2000 the German parliament approved a resolution regretting the fact that Paragraph 175 was retained after the war. Two years later it annulled the convictions of gay men under Nazi rule but not the post-war convictions.The compensation also applies to men convicted in communist East Germany which had a milder version of Paragraph 175 and decriminalized homosexuality in 1968.In all some 68300 people were convicted under various forms of Paragraph 175 in both German states.Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical advicePablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";249 persecuted over Nazi-era law receive compensation;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/germany-compensates-249-persecuted-law-homosexuality/;mindset;0.930000

And of course the businesspeople want to be able to import export — to do just what normal life is. So yes everyone wants the sanctions to be removed — but not just at any cost.""That cost for Iran's leadership would be losing face. Concerned with optics and defensive afterless than 50% of Iranians turned out to votein this summer's elections the government is determined not to appear desperate or weak.Iran youth shun voting embrace social media02:27Still many analysts think Iran has more to lose bynotgoing back to the negotiating table.""What matters at the end of the day is political will. How much there is in Iran is unclear. For sure some senior figures question returning to the JCPOA especially as there's a real chance the Democrats lose their legislative majority next year and the White House in 2024"" Ali Vaez Iran Project Director for the International Crisis Group told CBS News. ""The Iranians fear any sanctions relief under a renewed JCPOA will be temporary because a Republican government would simply renege on the deal as Trump did.""But for Iran's leaders Vaez said ""the alternative is equally unattractive. That is going back to the pattern of both sides ratcheting up the stakes — nuclear activity by Iran's side sanctions by the U.S. — which is mutually costly.""It's not clear whether the new administration under Raisi would send the same experienced negotiators appointed by the old government back to Vienna for a new round of talks or appoint a whole new team.But Raisi has transferred responsibility for Iran's nuclear file from the Foreign Ministry to the country's National Security Council which is aligned with the hardline Revolutionary Guards.If the talks do resume Vaez said progress would likely be slow.""If Iran's National Security Council takes on primary responsibility for the nuclear file the talks will become more complex and progress will be slower as every tactical issue will have to go through a consensus building mechanism in Tehran.""The nuclear agreement is in tatters. President Trump pulled the U.S. out of the deal in 2018 leaving behind Iran France the U.K. Germany Russia and China as signatories.Iran accused the U.S. of breaking its commitment thenwent on to break the rulesitself by enriching significantly more uranium than the JCPOA allows.Biden won't lift sanctions until Iran halts u...01:58Iran has now enriched uranium to almost 60% purity the closest to weapons-grade fissile material it's ever had.Tehran's growing stockpile of enriched uranium and other brazen violations of the nuclear deal may give it more leverage in any new negotiations. But those actions could also be an indication that Iran is feeling more confident that if push comes to shove it can do without a deal with the West thanks to its powerful new ally China.Bathaei says the Iranian government ""sees China as a backer as a partner as a market that they can rely on.""China is believed to be the biggest purchaser of Iranian oil which technically remains under U.S. sanction.

"Climate changecould push more than 200 million people to leave their homes in the next three decades and create migration hotspots unless urgent action is taken to reduce global emissions and bridge the development gap aWorld Bank reporthas found.The second part of the Groundswell report published on Monday examines how the impacts of slow-onset climate change such as water scarcity decreasing crop productivity and rising sea levels could lead to millions of what the report describes as ""climate migrants"" by 2050 under three different scenarios with varying degrees of climate action and development.Under the most pessimistic scenario with a high level of emissions and unequal development the report forecasts up to 216 million people moving within their own countries across the six regions analyzed. Those regions are Latin America; North Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; Eastern Europe and Central Asia; South Asia; and East Asia and the Pacific.In the most climate-friendly scenario with a low level of emissions and inclusive sustainable development the number of migrants could be as much as 80% lower but still result in the move of 44 million people.""We have to go"": Climate change driving increased migration from Central AmericaThe report didn't look at the short-term impacts of climate change such as effects on extreme weather eventsThe findings ""reaffirm the potency of climate to induce migration within countries"" said Viviane Wei Chen Clement a Senior Climate Change Specialist at the World Bank and one of the report's authors.In the worst-case scenario Sub-Saharan Africa — the most vulnerable region due to desertification fragile coastlines and the population's dependence on agriculture — would see the most movement with up to 86 million climate migrants moving within national borders.In this file photo taken Thursday Jan. 16 2020 a Samburu boy uses a wooden stick to try to swat a swarm of desert locusts filling the air as he herds his camel near the village of Sissia in Samburu county Kenya.Patrick Ngugi / APNorth Africa however is predicted to have the largest proportion of climate migrants with 19 million people moving equivalent to roughly 9% of its total population due mainly to increased water scarcity in the northeastern coast of Tunisia the northwestern coast of Algeria western and southern Morocco and the central Atlas foothills the report said.In South Asia Bangladesh is particularly affected by flooding and crop failures accounting for almost half of the predicted climate migrants with 19.9 million people including an increasing share of women moving by 2050 under the pessimistic scenario.""This is our humanitarian reality right now and we are concerned this is going to be even worse where vulnerability is more acute"" said Prof. Maarten van Aalst Director of the international Red Cross Red Crescent Climate CentreThe report did not look at climate migration across borders.""Globally we know that three out of four people that move stay within countries"" said Dr. Kanta Kumari Rigaud a lead environmental specialist at the World Bank and co-author of the report.Still migration patterns from rural to urban areas often precede movements across borders.Climate change driving migration from Central...05:28While climate change's influence on migration is not new it is often part of a combination of factors pushing people to move and acts as a threat multiplier. People affected by conflicts and inequality are also more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change as they have limited means to adapt.The report also warns that migration hotspots could appear within the next decade and intensify by 2050. Planning is needed both in the areas where people will move to and in theareas they leaveto help those who remain.Among the actions recommended were achieving ""net-zero emissions by mid-century to have a chance at limiting global warming to 1.5°C"" and investing in development that is ""green resilient and inclusive in line with the Paris Agreement.""Clement and Rigaud warned that the worst-case scenario is ""plausible"" if collective action to reduce emissions and invest in development isn't taken especially in the next decade.Climate ChangeMoreExtreme weather takes aim from coast to coastWhat to know about COP26 ahead of global climate summitU.N. reports record greenhouse gas levels despite COVID shutdownsWorld leaders prepare for UN climate summitHere's how climate change is hurting your healthMoreDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";Climate change could push 200 million people to move by 2050;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/climate-change-200-million-move-2050-world-bank-report/;mindset;0.930000

"North Koreasaid it successfully test fired what it described as newly developed long-range cruise missiles over the weekend its first known testing activity in months that underscored how it continues to expand its military capabilities amid astalemate in nuclear negotiationswith the United States.The Korean Central News Agency said Monday that the cruise missiles which had been under development for two years successfully hit targets 932 miles away during its flight tests on Saturday and Sunday. The North hailed its new missiles as a ""strategic weapon of great significance"" that meets leaderKim Jong Un's call to strengthen the country's military might implying that they were being developed with an intent to arm them with nuclear warheads.South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the military was analyzing the North Korean launches based on U.S. and South Korean intelligence.This combination of photos provided by the North Korean government on Monday September 13 2021 shows long-range cruise missiles tests held on September 11 -12 2021 in an undisclosed location of North Korea.Korean Central News Agency/Korea News Service via APKim during a congress of the ruling Workers' Party in January doubled down on his pledge to bolster his nuclear deterrent in the face of U.S. sanctions and pressure and issued a long wish list of new sophisticated assets including longer-range intercontinental ballistic missiles nuclear-powered submarines spy satellites and tactical nuclear weapons. Kim also said then that his national defense scientists were developing ""intermediate-range cruise missiles with the most powerful warheads in the world.""North Korea's weapons tests are meant to build a nuclear and missile program that can stand up to what it claims as U.S. and South Korean hostility but they are also considered by outside analysts as ways to make its political demands clear to leaders in Washington and Seoul.The North's resumption of testing activity is likely an attempt at pressuring the Biden administration over the diplomatic freeze after Kim failed to leverage his arsenal for economic benefits during the the presidency of Donald Trump.North Korea ended a yearlong pause in ballistic tests in March by firing two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea continuing a tradition of testing new U.S. administrations with weapons demonstrations aimed at measuring Washington's response and wresting concessions.But there hadn't been any known test launches for months after that as Kim focused national efforts on fending off the coronavirus and salvaging his economy.KCNA said the missiles tested over the weekend traveled for 126 minutes ""along an oval and pattern-8 flight orbits"" above North Korean land and waters before hitting their targets.""The test launches showed that the technical indices such as the thrust power of the newly developed turbine-blast engine the missiles' navigation control and the end guided hit accuracy by the combined guided mode met the requirements of designs. In all the efficiency and practicality of the weapon system operation was confirmed to be excellent"" it said.It appeared that Kim wasn't in attendance to observe the tests. KCNA said Kim's top military official Pak Jong Chon observed the test-firings and called for the country's defense scientists to go ""all out to increase"" the North's military capabilities.Kim's powerful sister last month hinted that North Korea was ready to resume weapons testing while issuing a statement berating the U.S. and South Korea for continuing their joint military exercises which she said was the ""most vivid expression of U.S. hostile policy.""She then said the North would boost its pre-emptive strike capabilities while another senior official threatened unspecified countermeasures that would leave the allies facing a ""security crisis.""The allies say the drills are defensive in nature but they have canceled or downsized them in recent years to create space for diplomacy or in response toCOVID-19.Talks between the U.S. and North Korea have stalled since the collapse of a summit betweenMr. Trump and Kim in 2019 when the Americans rejected the North's demand for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities. Kim's government has so far rejected the Biden administration's overtures for dialogue demanding that Washington abandon its ""hostile"" policies first.North Korea leader Kim Jong Un attends a paramilitary parade held to mark the 73rd founding anniversary of the republic at Kim Il Sung square in Pyongyang in this undated image supplied by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency on September 9 2021.KCNA/ReutersThe latest tests came after Kim threw anunusual paradein capital Pyongyang last week that was a marked departure from past militaristic displays showcasing anti-virus workers in hazmat suits and civil defense organizations involved in industrial work and rebuilding communities destroyed by floods instead of missiles and other provocative weaponry.Experts said that the parade was focused on domestic unity as Kim now faces perhaps his toughest test with North Korea wrestling with U.S.-led economic sanctions over its nuclear weapons pandemic border closures that are causing further strain to its broken economy and food shortages worsened by floods in recent summers.North KoreaMoreSouth Korea has partial success with 1st launch into the space raceNorth Korea confirms test of missile designed for submarine launchN.

"Great white shark attacks are rare and when they do occur they are sometimes fatal. But attacks against the human species are often a result of mistaken identity new research published on Tuesday shows.Thestudy published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface was conducted by looking at humans and animals from a great white shark's eye view below the ocean surface. It's often been assumed that it's hard for sharks to differentiate between them but there is little research taking into account how sharks see rather than just from their perspective from underwater.Sharks according to the research have limited color perception if they are not completely color blind and have spatial resolving power that is ""considerably worse than humans."" So when they are looking for prey researchers found they more heavily rely on motion and brightness contrast.To determine how great white sharks primarily juveniles since they are most often the ones involved in human interactions might see objects when looking up from below the ocean surface researchers specifically compared video footage of rectangular floats humans swimming humans paddling surfboards and pinnipeds including sea lions and seals. The footage was filtered to mimic the sharks' visual system.And as it turns out the researchers found that juvenile great whites cannot significantly differentiate between the different life forms. The silhouettes of the different objects at the surface are too similar for the animals given their reliance on motion and light.""From the perspective of a white shark...neither visual motion nor shape cues allow an unequivocal visual distinction between pinnipeds and humans"" the study says ""supporting the mistaken identity theory behind some bites.""Laura Ryan the lead author of the study said in apress releasefrom Macquarie University that surfers are the most at-risk for fatal shark bites particularly from juveniles.""We found that surfers swimmers and pinnipeds (seals and sea lions) on the surface of the ocean will look the same to a white shark looking up from below because these sharks can't see fine details or colours"" she said.Professor Nathan Hart senior author of the study said thatgreat whiteshave to learn what to eat and their diet changes as they grow and learn. This could explain why juvenile sharks tend to be more commonly involved in biting humans. Adult sharks researchers said tend to have better vision and can better differentiate.""They need to develop a search image for these prey items and combine that with other sensory information"" Hart said. ""It's a learning process that could be prone to mistakes.""The study was also conducted in a controlled pool setting rather than the ocean leading researchers to believe that the sharks' ability to differentiate between humans and prey is actually worse because of the lower visibility in oceans. They also believe that the mistaken identity theory could apply to other shark species associated with human fatalities such as tiger sharks or bull sharks.But researchers also urged people to remember that shark bites are rare. In 2020 there were 57 confirmed unprovokedshark attack casesworldwide according to the University of Florida's International Shark Attack File. The 2015 to 2019 average was 80 incidents every year.They also reiterated that sharks themselves are endangered. In January scientists announced that shark and ray populations havedeclined more than 70%over the past 50 years with overfishing being a main culprit. Fish nets and drum lines often placed under water to ward off the animals only further threaten the species and other marine life researchers of the great white study found.They hope their findings can help find better ways to prevent future shark bites and provide an overall better understanding of the creatures that are vital to marine ecosystems.""Understanding why shark bites occur can help us find ways to prevent them"" Ryan said ""while keeping both humans and sharks safer.""Direction and strength of motion cues from the 2DMD model of (a–c) a pinniped swimming (d–f) a human paddling a surfboard (g–i) a human swimming and (j–l) a rectangular float towed through the water. Modelling was performed assuming a spatial resolving power of either 5 cpd (behk) or 2.5 cpd (cfil). Red open dots indicate angle vectors that were significantly different from the pinniped and black dots were not significantly different. Units are an arbitrary scaling value. Dashed lines on (a) show the division of the object for analysis of the different 'faces'.

"What happens when you hang a rhinoceros upside down? That's what a group of researchers from Cornell University and Namibia's Ministry of Environment wanted to find out.

According to the researchers nobody had ever checked to see if the health of a tranquilized rhino was compromised when being airlifted upside down.A tranquilized rhino hangs in the air.Namibian Ministry of the Environment Forestry and TourismAs it turns out the rhinos coped very well — and better in this unusual position than simply lying on their side or chest. That's likely good news for conservation efforts as the number of rhinos has been decimated by poaching in part from rising demand for rhino horn under the mistaken belief it has medicinal qualities. It's estimated at least one rhino is killed every day and only around 5500 are left.Other research that earned a 2021 Ig Nobelincludes a study that linked the obesity of a country's politicians to its level of corruption and another that tested whether humans evolved beards to protect themselves from punches to the face.Saving rhino with helicopters12:51Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesPablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical adviceSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";Researchers who dangled rhinos upside down earn Ig Nobel;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ig-nobel-prize-rhinos-upside-down-improbable-research/;mindset;0.930000
"Seoul South Korea—North Koreaheld a parade on Thursday showcasing military dogs and virus workers in orange hazmat suits but leader Kim Jong Un still managed to seize the spotlight by looking thinner and more energetic than he has in years. During the event late Wednesday Kim wearing a cream-colored suit and a shiny white tie emerged as the clock struck midnight. He beamed in response to thunderous applause from performers and spectators filling Pyongyang's brightly illuminated Kim Il Sung Square named after his grandfather the country's founder.He smiled widely waved to the crowd and kissed children who presented him with flowers before taking his spot on a balcony to observe the parade. He laughed vigorously and applauded the marchers throughout the event while holding animated chats with senior officials.""Deeply troubling"": North Korea restarts nuclear reactorIt was a stark change from 2018 when TV footage showed him struggling to catch his breath while accompanying South Korean President Moon Jae-in on a short hike to North Korea's Mount Paektu during a period of diplomatic engagement. Moon who is three decades older than Kim didn't seemed fazed by the walk at all.North Korea leader Kim Jong Un attends a paramilitary parade held to mark the 73rd founding anniversary of the republic at Kim Il Sung square in Pyongyang in this undated image supplied by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency on September 9 2021.KCNA/Reuters""His face is clearly thinner and he is moving much more vigorously"" said Park Won-gon a professor of North Korea studies at Seoul's Ewha Womans University.Kim's weight lossbecame noticeable in June when he made his first public appearance in weeks to convene a ruling party meeting. Some North Korea watchers then said that Kim who is about 5 feet 8 inches tall and has previously weighed 308 pounds may have lost 22-44 pounds.Most experts say Kim's weight loss is more likely a result of efforts to improve his shape than an indicator of health problems considering his regular public activity. It may also have a political purpose.Kim is facing perhaps his toughest moment as he approaches a decade of rule with North Korea wrestling with U.S.-led economic sanctions over its nuclear weapons pandemic border closures that cause further strain to its broken economy and food shortages made worse by floods in recent summers.It has become crucial for Kim to build an image as a young and vigorous leader who can navigate the country out of trouble analyst Park said. Such image-making efforts would align with the latest parade which showcased civil defense units involved in efforts to rebuild the economy and communities destroyed by floods and emphasized a domestic message for unity.North Korea leader Kim Jong Un (C) attends a paramilitary parade held to mark the 73rd founding anniversary of the republic at Kim Il Sung square in Pyongyang in this undated image supplied by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency on September 9 2021.KCNA/ReutersYang Moo-jin a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul said Kim with his weight loss and cheerful demeanor at the parade is likely trying to project an image of a ""normal statesman"" who engages with the public.""He's also a husband and a father of three children who is approaching his 40s so it isn't strange that he would care about his health"" Yang said.Kim's health is the focus of keen outside attention as the 37-year-old leader hasn't publicly anointed a successor who would take control of North Korea's advancing nuclear arsenal targeting Asian rivals and the American homeland. He has been known for heavy drinking and smoking and comes from a family with a history of heart problems. His father and grandfather who ruled North Korea before him both died of heart issues.""Considering the North's political system where the supreme leader decides everything Kim's health is an extremely important security matter"" Park said. ""It's likely there were internal concerns that he was overweight and it would have been important for Kim to reduce those concerns and present himself as a young and healthy leader who's capable of doing things.""Dr. Cheong Seong-Chang Director of the Center for North Korean Studies at the Sejong Institute in South Korea told CBS News that Kim may also have wanted with the parade to ""show the world that North Korea is safe from the coronavirus as they have repeatedly said.""North KoreaMoreSouth Korea has partial success with 1st launch into the space raceNorth Korea confirms test of missile designed for submarine launchN.

The alliance itself was also charged with subversion.Chow was denied bail days after she wasarrested for failing to comply with a police request for information. Lee and Ho are currently serving jail sentences for their roles in unauthorized assemblies in 2019. The next court hearing for the case is scheduled for Oct. 28.For the past 30 years the alliance organized the candlelight vigil that saw tens of thousands of people mass in the city's Victoria Park to commemorate China's bloody military crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square on June 4 1989.It was the only large-scale public commemoration of the crackdown on Chinese soil featuring crowds of people lighting candles and singing songs to support democracy.Chow Hang-tung second from left vice chairwoman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China and other group members attend a news conference in Hong Kong   September 5 2021.Kin Cheung/APPolice havebanned the vigilsfor the past two years citingthe coronavirus pandemic although critics believe the ban is part of the crackdown on dissent that Beijing and Hong Kong's leaders have waged following months of anti-government protests in the territory in 2019.Authorities have now characterized the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China as a foreign agent and sought details about the group's operations and finances in connection with its alleged activities and links with democracy groups overseas.Chow and four other leading members of the alliance had refused to cooperate with the police request for information and were arrested this week for failing to comply.Police on Thursday confiscated computers documents and promotional materials from the closed June 4 museum which was run by the alliance to commemorate the Tiananmen crackdown.Police said 2.2 million Hong Kong dollars ($280000) worth of assets belonging to the alliance were also frozen.On Friday a Facebook post was posted on Chow's account urging Hong Kongers not to ""accept their fate.""""Maybe the other party will crush the 'obstacle' that is us but resistance is about gathering strength in exchange for some time and space to allow more 'obstacles' the opportunity to grow"" the post said. ""As long as we still have the will to fight we have not lost.""Over the past year dozens of pro-democracy activists have been arrested others have left the city for exile abroad and the city has amended electoral laws to increase the number of seats for pro-Beijing legislators while reducing those that are directly elected.Hong Kong's National Security Law: One year l...01:16The national security law imposed by Beijing on the city in June last year criminalizes subversion secession terrorism and foreign collusion to interfere in the city's affairs.Critics say the law which has been used to arrest more than 100 people rolls back freedoms promised to the former British colony when it was handed over to China in 1997.

The silhouettes of the different objects at the surface are too similar for the animals given their reliance on motion and light.""From the perspective of a white shark...neither visual motion nor shape cues allow an unequivocal visual distinction between pinnipeds and humans"" the study says ""supporting the mistaken identity theory behind some bites.""Laura Ryan the lead author of the study said in apress releasefrom Macquarie University that surfers are the most at-risk for fatal shark bites particularly from juveniles.""We found that surfers swimmers and pinnipeds (seals and sea lions) on the surface of the ocean will look the same to a white shark looking up from below because these sharks can't see fine details or colours"" she said.Professor Nathan Hart senior author of the study said thatgreat whiteshave to learn what to eat and their diet changes as they grow and learn. This could explain why juvenile sharks tend to be more commonly involved in biting humans. Adult sharks researchers said tend to have better vision and can better differentiate.""They need to develop a search image for these prey items and combine that with other sensory information"" Hart said. ""It's a learning process that could be prone to mistakes.""The study was also conducted in a controlled pool setting rather than the ocean leading researchers to believe that the sharks' ability to differentiate between humans and prey is actually worse because of the lower visibility in oceans. They also believe that the mistaken identity theory could apply to other shark species associated with human fatalities such as tiger sharks or bull sharks.But researchers also urged people to remember that shark bites are rare. In 2020 there were 57 confirmed unprovokedshark attack casesworldwide according to the University of Florida's International Shark Attack File. The 2015 to 2019 average was 80 incidents every year.They also reiterated that sharks themselves are endangered. In January scientists announced that shark and ray populations havedeclined more than 70%over the past 50 years with overfishing being a main culprit. Fish nets and drum lines often placed under water to ward off the animals only further threaten the species and other marine life researchers of the great white study found.They hope their findings can help find better ways to prevent future shark bites and provide an overall better understanding of the creatures that are vital to marine ecosystems.""Understanding why shark bites occur can help us find ways to prevent them"" Ryan said ""while keeping both humans and sharks safer.""Direction and strength of motion cues from the 2DMD model of (a–c) a pinniped swimming (d–f) a human paddling a surfboard (g–i) a human swimming and (j–l) a rectangular float towed through the water. Modelling was performed assuming a spatial resolving power of either 5 cpd (behk) or 2.5 cpd (cfil). Red open dots indicate angle vectors that were significantly different from the pinniped and black dots were not significantly different. Units are an arbitrary scaling value. Dashed lines on (a) show the division of the object for analysis of the different 'faces'.

"France will start offering free contraceptives for young women next year to help with the financial costs of protecting against pregnancy French Health Minister Olivier Véran announced on Thursday.Véran said women under the age of 25 would not be charged for appointments tests or other medical needs related to birth control starting January 1 2022.Last year the government made contraception completely free regardless of insurance to girls under 15 for the first time after previously offering it for ages 15 to 18 as part of a bid to end underage abortions. Abortions have been free for all women and girls in the country since 2012.""It is intolerable that young women cannot protect themselves cannot have contraception if they choose to do so because it is too expensive for them"" Véran saidon France 2 a public broadcaster adding that the government noticed a decline in the use of contraceptives among some young women because of the cost.The age of 25 was chosen as a threshold because it's an age in which more ""autonomy"" is assumed in terms of ""social and financial"" development Véran said and because 25 is the age people in France are no longer covered by their parents' health insurance.""This is very positive"" said Suzy Rojtman a spokeswoman for Le Collectif National pour les Droits des Femmes a French women's rights nonprofit. But she said it should not be used by politicians as a ""loophole to avoid increasing [the] abortion time limit"" in France which is currently between 12-14 weeks of pregnancy.While this measure has been applauded by many French medical organizations French legislator Albane Gaillot notes that financial cost is not the only obstacle to contraception use.""There is a lack of information regarding contraception use but more importantly regarding sexuality and its implications. There needs to be better communication and information about the different contraceptives available to women and the possibility to access doctors that will help women choose an option that suits them.""The measure will cost the government about 21 million euros or almost $25 million per year Véran said.Several European countries including Germany Belgium the Netherlands and Norway make contraception free for teens.

"Geneva— North Korea was formally suspended from the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics by the IOC on Wednesday as punishment forrefusing to send a team to the Tokyo Gamesciting the COVID-19 pandemic. IOC president Thomas Bach said the North Korean national Olympic body will also now forfeit money it was due from previous Olympics. The unspecified amount - potentially millions of dollars - had been withheld because of international sanctions.Individual athletes from North Korea who qualify to compete in Beijing could still be accepted by a separate decision in the future Bach said.The suspension marks a steep drop in North Korea's Olympic status since the 2018 Winter Games in South Korea where the International Olympic Committeetried to aid a diplomatic breakthrough.Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Opening ceremony – Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium- Pyeongchang South Korea – February 9 2018 - Cheerleaders of North Korea await the start of the opening ceremony.ReutersAthletes from the Korean neighbors marched together in the opening ceremony at Pyeongchang and joined together in a women's ice hockey team.North Korea withdrew its team in April from the Tokyo Olympics citing a need to protect athletes from the ""world public health crisis caused by COVID-19.""""They were violating the Olympic Charter and did not fulfill their obligation as stated in the Olympic Charter to participate"" Bach said at a news conference after an IOC executive board meeting.The North Korean Olympic committee is suspended through 2022 and the exclusion could be extended he said.North Koreasent 10 competitors to the 2018 Winter Games none in 2014 at Sochi Russia and two to Vancouver in 2010.Asked what the IOC's message would be to countries like North Korea and Afghanistan — where women risk losing the right to play sports — Bach said taking part in the Olympics can ""show to the world how it could look like if everybody would respect the same rules if everybody would live together peacefully without any kind of discrimination.""Bach had earlier talked about the IOC supporting efforts to help athletes and officials leave Afghanistan with humanitarian visas and extending financial help for the country's potential Olympic competitors.Less than five months from the start of the 2022 Winter Games it was suggested to Bach that China's treatment of its Muslim minority Uyghur people was also a humanitarian issue and not yet directly addressed by the IOC.""There are limitations in our influence"" the IOC president said. ""It's to take care of humanitarian issues within the Olympic community. This is what we are doing.""Bach was reluctant to comment on FIFA's plan to play men's and women's World Cups every two years - a move that would see soccer absorb billions of dollars more in commercial revenue and global media attention.If FIFA can get its proposal approved it would likely mean moving its marquee event to odd-number years to avoid a near-direct clash - including for broadcasters sponsors and fans - with the Summer Games in 2028 2032 and beyond.""The potential consequences of such a move are becoming clearer day by day"" Bach said adding he would ""not put fuel to the fire"" by speculating though the IOC closely followed the talks and finds them ""interesting.""He put his faith in ""the contributions of the continental associations of FIFA"" - an apparent reference to European soccer body UEFA which has pledged to fight  changing the World Cup's quadrennial cycle.Tokyo OlympicsMoreOlympic cyclist says she was pregnant when she won silver medalParalympian stripped of gold medal for being 3 minutes lateAfghan flag displayed during Paralympics opening ceremonyOlympian auctions off medal to help pay for infant's heart surgeryAshleigh Johnson on Olympic gold diversity in aquatic sportsMoreDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";IOC suspends North Korea from next Olympics for skipping Tokyo Games;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/north-korea-suspended-2022-beijing-winter-olympics-for-skipping-tokyo/;mindset;0.930000

The ""Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China"" is one of few such groups still in existence after two years ofcrackdown on pro-democracy activists by Beijing.It has become a household name as it organizes the city's yearly June 4th vigil marking Beijing's bloody 1989 crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square.Critics say the arrests are just the latest erosion of the rights and freedoms that Hong Kong used to enjoy before Beijing invoked a controversial national security law last year to muzzle criticism of China's central government.Sentence coming in Hong Kong security law cas...06:29Hong Kong may seem peaceful and normal after the 2019 mass-protests that rocked the city but critics continue to raise the alarm as democratic institutions built up and enjoyed for decades are still being hollowed out.

However several hours into the first day the launch of Chivo the government's digital wallet app that allows Salvadoran citizens to transact in the volatilecryptocurrency suffered snags and the price of bitcoin fell as much as 10% as of early Tuesday afternoon.Bitcoin can now be used as a legal tender for any business that can support and process transactions with it months after the Latin American country's congress approved the move. While the financial world awaits how El Salvador executes the rollout the country's president Nayib Bukele suggested on Monday that there would be a ""learning curve.""""Every road to the future is like this and not everything will be achieved in a day or in a month.

As bitcoin prices were falling during hitches with Chivo Bukele said the countrybought 150 moreof the cryptocurrency at a ""discount"" after purchasing400 bitcoinsa day earlier.Meanwhile some fast food chains operating in El Salvador such as McDonald's andPizza Hut have already begun to accept bitcoin as a form of payment in the country.

According toWorld Bank data remittances to the country made up nearly $6 billion — or almost 20% of its gross domestic product — in 2019. Buekele previously said bitcoin could improve financial inclusion and access to wealth in a desperately poor nation.As legal tender in El Salvador bitcoin can be used in any transaction and businesses will have to accept that payment form according to thelegislationpassed in June. The law also states that tax contributions can be paid via bitcoin and exchanges in the cryptocurrency will not be subject to capital gains tax.Under the new law El Salvador will ""promote necessary training and mechanisms so that the population can access [bitcoin] transactions."" However those who do not have access to technologies that can carry out bitcoin are excluded from being required to accept it as payment.  The U.S. dollar and bitcoin are the country's official currencies.The move brings financial risks to ordinary Salvadorans and their country experts say as the cryptocurrency gains and loses huge amounts of value in a flash — and at times overnight.

"New Delhi— Authorities in India's southern Kerala state are racing to contain an outbreak of theNipah virus. The virus which is not related to thecoronavirus behind the current global pandemicand is far more deadly killed a 12-year-old boy in Kerala over the weekend prompting stepped-up efforts to trace his contacts. New infections have been confirmed.The boy was admitted to a hospital a week ago with high fever. As his condition worsened and doctors suspected inflammation of his brain (encephalitis) his blood samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology where tests confirmed a Nipah infection. He died early on Sunday.Government authorities have stepped up contact tracing efforts identifying quarantining and testing people who may have come into contact with the young victim. According to the state's health minister Veena George 188 people who came into contact with the boy had been identified by Monday. Of them 20 were considered high-risk primary contacts — primarily his family members all of whom were being held under strict quarantine or hospitalized.Two healthcare workers who came into contact with the victim were already showing symptoms of Nipah infection by Monday. They were admitted to a hospital and their blood samples sent for testing.Climate change's role in the COVID pandemicAuthorities sealed off the area within about a two-mile radius of the boy's home and they were screening people for symptoms in all adjoining districts of Kerala state. The neighboring state of Tamil Nadu was also on high alert for any suspect cases of fever.This is the second time in three years that a Nipah virus outbreak has been reported in Kerala which is also reeling under a high rate of COVID-19 infections. The state reports about 68% of India's approximately 40000 new cases every day.What is Nipah virus?Like the coronavirus Nipah is a zoonotic virus or one that is transmitted from animals to humans. Transmission generally occurs when humans either come into direct contact with the animals or through consumption of contaminated food. But a high number of human-to-human transmission cases of Nipah have also been reported.Fruit bats of the family Pteropodidae — commonly known as the ""flying fox"" — are the natural carriers of Nipah. They are known to transmit the virus to other animals including pigs dogs cats goats horses and sheep.Animal Husbandry department and Forest officials deposit a bat into a container after catching it inside a well at Changaroth in Kozhikode in the Indian state of Kerala on May 21 2018.GettyAn infected human typically shows symptoms including fever and headache for anywhere between three days and two weeks followed by a cough sore throat and respiratory issues. The condition later progresses swiftly to swelling in the brain cells leading to drowsiness confusion and then possible coma and death.There is no cure or vaccine for Nipah yet and patients are only given supportive medical care.According to the World Health Organization up to75% of Nipah infections prove fatal. The mortality rate for the coronavirus by comparison is believed to be about 2%. About 20% of survivors experience neurological symptoms that can persist including seizures and personality changes.A wider threat?The Nipah virus was first discovered in Malaysia in 1999 during an outbreak among pig farmers. Since then there have been multiple outbreaks — all of them in South and Southeast Asia. In all it is known to have killed more than 260 people.Animal Husbandry department and Forest officials inspect a well to to catch bats at Changaroth in Kozhikode in the Indian state of Kerala May 21 2018.GettyA 2004 Bangladesh outbreak was traced back to humans consuming date palm sap that had been contaminated by infected fruit bats. The last outbreak in India whichhit Kerala in 2018 killed 17 of the 18 people who caught it. Those infections were all traced back to fruit bats found dead in the water of a family's well.Nipah is considered less contagious than the coronavirus but its much higher mortality rate a longer incubation period of up to 45 days and its ability to infect a much wider variety of animals all make Nipah a cause of significant concern for epidemiologists trying to predict and prevent the next pandemic.Veasna Duong head of virology at the Institut Pasteur research lab in Phnom Penh Cambodia has studied human-bat interactions in the region and he told the BBC earlier this year that the close proximity that people and bats find themselves in at markets and other crowded places across Asia poses a serious risk.Paramedics bury the body of Valachekutti Mosa who died of the Nipah virus in Kozhikode in the southern Indian state of Kerala  May 24 2018.K.Shijith/AP""This kind of exposure might allow the virus to mutate which might cause a pandemic"" Duong told the BBC'sFutureprogram adding that in some circumstances the virus could even find a host to carry it out of Asia.""We observe [fruit bats] here and in Thailand in markets worship areas schools and tourist locations like Angkor Wat – there's a big roost of bats there"" he told the BBC'sFutureprogram. ""In a normal year Angkor Wat hosts 2.6 million visitors. That's 2.6 million opportunities for Nipah virus to jump from bats to humans annually in just one location.""From the archives: Hunting viruses13:18Scientists warn that as the climate warms and humans destroy more natural habitat of species like the fruit bats in Asiaopportunities for new zoonotic variants to emerge increase.The WHO says in itsnote on the Nipah virusthat ""the risk of international transmission via fruits or fruit products (such as raw date palm juice) contaminated with urine or saliva from infected fruit bats can be prevented by washing them thoroughly and peeling them before consumption. Fruit with signs of bat bites should be discarded.""Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical advicePablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";Authorities racing to contain deadly Nipah virus outbreak in India;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nipah-virus-outbreak-india-kerala/;mindset;0.930000

"Moscow —A court in Belarus handed a 11-year jail sentence toMaria Kolesnikova an opposition leader who inspired massive protests against dictatorial rule of Alexander Lukashenko last year state media reported.Kolesnikova's lawyer Maxim Znak was also sentenced to 10 years in prison. In a closed trial they were found guilty of threatening the ""national security"" of Belarus founding an extremist group and conspiring to ""seize power in an unconstitutional way.""Belarusian opposition politician Maria Kolesnikova charged with extremism and trying to seize power illegally forms a heart shape in handcuffs inside a defendants' cage as she attends a court hearing in Minsk Belarus September 6 2021.Ramil Nasibulin/BelTA/Handout via REUTERSTens of thousands of people protested across Belarus following last year's presidential election in which Lukashenko who has ruled the country with an iron fist since 1994 declared victory. Many local and international observers criticized the election as fraudulent and the ballot-counting process as non-transparent.Kolesnikova was a campaign manager for president hopeful Viktor Babaryko who was put into a KGB prison ahead of the vote in a move seen as a way to remove tough competition for Lukashenko.Kolesnikova then stepped into the spotlight protesting alongside Veronika Tsepkalo and Svetlana Tikhonovskaya the wife of another jailed candidate and popular blogger Sergey TikhanovskyThe three women campaigned across the country with Tikhonovskaya running in her husband's place and subsequently contesting Lukashenko's claim to victory.Both Tikhonovskaya and Tsepkalo have since fled the country and Kolesnikova is the only major protest leader remaining in Belarus. She wasdetained by KGB agentslast September who put a sack over her head and drove the politician to the Ukrainian border in an attempt to deport her.But Kolesnikova refused to leave Belarus and tore up her passport.""She was screaming that she would not go anywhere"" Kolesnikova's colleague Anton Rodnenkov who was also detained and deported to Ukraine told Radio Liberty at the time. ""As soon as she was in the car and saw her passport she immediately tore it into many small pieces and threw out the window.""""After that she climbed out of a window and walked towards the Belarusian border"" Rodnenkov added.In video clips from inside the courtroom posted on Monday Kolesnikova appeared defiant — smiling and wearing her signature red lipstick.Both Kolesnikova and Znak pleaded not guilty and called the process unlawfulMediaZonareported citing their lawyer Vadym Pylchenko.The U.S. and EU imposed tough economic sanctions on the Lukashenko regime after he launched a brutal crackdown on protests last year resulting in thousands of detentions. Human rights groups issued multiple reports shedding light on torture and persecution of jailed dissidents in Belarus.""The persecution and imprisonment of Maria Kolesnikova and Maxim Znak is intended to destroy the hopes of millions of people on whose behalf they spoke up - a whole generation of Belarusians who strive to ensure that peaceful changes take place in their country and that human rights are respected"" Bruce Miller Amnesty International's Deputy Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia said in a statement to CBS.""We demand that Maria Kolesnikova Maxim Znak and hundreds of other people jailed in Belarus solely for exercising their human rights are released immediately.""Despite international pressure Lukashenko has continued to push his country towards a path of isolation. In May he faced intenseinternational criticism when authorities diverted a passenger planeand forced it to land in Minsk detaining two dissidents onboard.With protests coming to a halt under pressure from special services the Belarusian president found a strong backer in Russian leader Vladimir Putin and has so far shown no signs of backing down.CBS News' Svetlana Berdnikova contributed to this report.Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical advicePablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";Belarus opposition leader Maria Kolesnikova gets 11 years in jail;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/maria-kolesnikova-belarus-opposition-leader-sentenced-11-years-jail/;mindset;0.930000

"Conakry Guinea— Mutinous soldiers in the West African nation of Guinea detained President Alpha Conde on Sunday after hours of heavy gunfire rang out near the presidential palace in the capital then announced on state television that the government had been dissolved in an apparent coup d'etat.Special forces members are seen during an uprising that led to the toppling of president Alpha Conde in Kaloum neighbourhood of Conakry Guinea September 5 2021.SALIOU SAMB/REUTERSThe country's borders were closed and its constitution was declared invalid in the announcement read aloud on state television by army Col. Mamadi Doumbouya who told Guineans: ""The duty of a soldier is to save the country.""""We will no longer entrust politics to one man. We will entrust it to the people"" said Doumbouya draped in a Guinean flag with about a half dozen other soldiers flanked at his side.It was not immediately known though how much support Doumbouya had within the military or whether other soldiers loyal to the president of more than a decade might attempt to wrest back control.The junta later announced plans to replace Guinea's governors with regional commanders at an event Monday and warned: ""Any refusal to appear will be considered rebellion"" against the country's new military leaders.The West African regional bloc known as ECOWAS quickly condemned the developments threatening sanctions if Conde was not immediately released. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres tweeted that he strongly condemned ""any takeover of the government by force of the gun.""The U.S. State Department warned against violence and urged authorities in Guinea to avoid ""extra-constitutional"" actions that ""will only erode Guinea's prospects for peace stability and prosperity."" Spokesman Ned Price added in a statement that the junta's ""actions could limit the ability of the United States and Guinea's other international partners to support the country.""Conde's whereabouts had been unknown for hours after the intense fighting Sunday in downtown Conakry until a video emerged showing the 83-year-old leader tired and disheveled in military custody.A screen grab from a video shared on social media but not yet authenticated claims to show Guinea's President Alpha Conde detained by army special forces in Conakry Guinea September 5 2021.SOCIAL MEDIA/ReutersThe junta later released a statement saying Conde was in contact with his doctors. But they gave no timeline for releasing him other than to do say: ""Everything will be fine. When the time comes we will issue a statement.""Conde in power for more than a decade had seen his popularity plummet since he sought a third term last year saying that term limits did not apply to him. Sunday's dramatic developments underscored how dissent had mounted within the military as well.Doumbouya who had been the commander of the army's special forces unit called on other soldiers ""to put themselves on the side of the people"" and stay in their barracks. The army colonel said he was acting in the best interests of the nation citing a lack of economic progress by leaders since the country gained independence from France in 1958.""If you see the state of our roads if you see the state of our hospitals you realize that after 72 years it's time to wake up"" he said. ""We have to wake up.""Observers though say the tensions between Guinea's president and the army colonel stemmed from a recent proposal to cut some military salaries.On Sunday morning heavy gunfire broke out near the presidential palace and went on for hours sparking fears in a nation that already has seen multiple coups and presidential assassination attempts. The Defense Ministry initially claimed that the attack had been repelled by security forces but uncertainty grew when there was no subsequent sign of Conde on state television or radio.The developments that followed closely mirrored other military coup d'etats in West Africa: The army colonel and his colleagues seized control of the airwaves professing their commitment to democratic values and announcing their name: The National Committee for Rally and Development.It was a dramatic setback for Guinea where many had hoped the country had turned the page on military power grabs.Conde's 2010 election victory — the country's first democratic vote ever — was supposed to be a fresh start for a country that had been mired by decades of corrupt authoritarian rule and political turmoil. In the years since though opponents said Conde too failed to improve the lives of Guineans most of whom live in poverty despite the country's vast mineral riches of bauxite and gold.Guinean President Alpha Conde delivers a speech during a ceremony marking the 75th anniversary of the Allied landings in Provence in World War Two which helped liberate southern France in Boulouris France August 15 2019.ERIC GAILLARD/REUTERSThe year after his first election he narrowly survived an assassination attempt after gunmen surrounded his home overnight and pounded his bedroom with rockets. Rocket-propelled grenades landed inside the compound and one of his bodyguards was killed.Violent street demonstrations broke out last year after Conde organized a referendum to modify the constitution. The unrest intensified after he won the October election and the opposition said dozens were killed during the crisis.In neighboring Senegal which has a large diaspora of Guineans who opposed Conde news of his political demise was met with relief.""President Alpha Conde deserves to be deposed. He stubbornly tried to run for a third term when he had no right to do so"" said Malick Diallo a young Guinean shopkeeper in the suburbs of Dakar.""We know that a coup d'etat is not good"" said Mamadou Saliou Diallo another Guinean living in Senegal. ""A president must be elected by democratic vote. But we have no choice. We have a president who is too old who no longer makes Guineans dream and who does not want to leave power.""Guinea has had a long history of political instability. In 1984 Lansana Conte took control of the country after the first post-independence leader died. He remained in power for a quarter century until his death in 2008 accused of siphoning off state coffers to enrich his family and friends.The country's second coup soon followed putting army Capt. Moussa ""Dadis"" Camara in charge. During his rule security forces opened fire on demonstrators at a stadium in Conakry who were protesting his plans to run for president. Human rights groups have said more than 150 people were killed and at least 100 women were raped. Camara later went into exile after surviving an assassination attempt and a transitional government organized the landmark 2010 election won by Conde.Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical advicePablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";Military commanders stage coup in Guinea detain president;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/guinea-coup-alpha-conde-president-removed-from-power-by-military/;mindset;0.930000

The passengers are being held nearby because the Taliban won't let them into the airport according to a senior congressional source.""The U.S. airfield in Qatar that has been standing by ready to receive is now beginning to pack up"" Marina LeGree the group's executive director told CBS News. ""We hope visibility will add pressure to force a solution.

""We are however providing guidance and assistance to the extent possible — and with an emphasis on safety— to private entities working out of Mazar.""Congressional and NGO sources told CBS news there are at least two physical planes on the ground and six more with approved clearance. The obstacle is the Taliban which controls the airport and is not letting people board or the planes take off.""We had six airplanes at the airport six airplanes with American citizens on them as I speak also with these interpreters and the Taliban is holding them hostage for demands right now"" Representative Michael McCaul a Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee told Fox News on Sunday.The State Department told members of Congress it would continue to ""monitor"" the Taliban grounding of flights and work with lawmakers on the issue.

"Taliban special forces in camouflage fired their weapons into the air Saturday bringing an abrupt and frightening end to the latest protest march in the capital by Afghan women demanding equal rights from the new rulers.Also on Saturday the chief of Pakistan's powerful intelligence agency which has an outsized influence on the Taliban made a surprise visit to Kabul.The women's march the second in as many days in Kabul began peacefully. Demonstrators laid a wreath outside Afghanistan's Defense Ministry to honor Afghan soldiers who died fighting the Taliban before marching on to the presidential palace.""We are here to gain human rights in Afghanistan"" said 20-year-old protester Maryam Naiby. ""I love my country. I will always be here.""As the protesters' shouts grew louder several Taliban officials waded into the crowd to ask what they wanted to say.Flanked by fellow demonstrators Sudaba Kabiri a 24-year-old university student told her Taliban interlocutor that Islam's Prophet gave women rights and they wanted theirs. The Taliban official promised women would be given their rights but the women all in their early 20s were skeptical.As the demonstrators reached the presidential palace a dozen Taliban special forces ran into the crowd firing in the air and sending demonstrators fleeing. Kabiri who spoke to The Associated Press said they also fired tear gas.Women gather to demand their rights under the Taliban rule during a protest in Kabul Afghanistan Saturday Sept. 4 2021.Kathy Gannon/APThe Taliban have promised an inclusive government and a more moderate form of Islamic rule than when they last ruled the country from 1996 to 2001. But many Afghans especially women are deeply skeptical and fear a roll back of rights gained over the last two decades.For much of the past two weeks Taliban officials have been holding meetings among themselves amid reports of differences among them emerging. Early on Saturday neighboring Pakistan's powerful intelligence chief General Faiez Hameed made a surprise visit to Kabul. It wasn't immediately clear what he had to say to the Taliban leadership but the Pakistani intelligence service has a strong influence on the Taliban.Faiez' visit comes as the world waits to see what kind of government the Taliban will eventually announce seeking one that is inclusive and ensures protection of women's rights and the country's minorities.The Taliban have promised a broad-based government and have held talks with former president Hamid Karzai and the former government's negotiation chief Abdullah Abdullah. But the makeup of the new government is uncertain and it was unclear whether hard-line ideologues among the Taliban will win the day and whether the rollbacks feared by the demonstrating women will occur.Taliban members whitewashed murals Saturday that promoted health care warned of the dangers of HIV and even paid homage to some of Afghanistan's iconic foreign contributors like anthropologist Nancy Dupree who singlehandedly chronicled Afghanistan's rich cultural legacy. It was a worrying sign of attempts to erase reminders of the past 20 years.The murals were replaced with slogans congratulating Afghans on their victory.A Taliban cultural commission spokesman Ahmadullah Muttaqi tweeted that the murals were painted over ""because they are against our values. They were spoiling the minds of the mujahedeen and instead we wrote slogans that will be useful to everyone.""Afghanistan: The New RealityMoreISIS-K could be able to launch attacks out of Afghanistan within a year: DOD officialHumanitarian crisis surges under Taliban ruleFormer chief negotiator for U.S. Zalmay Khalilzad sticks by his Taliban dealAmericans in Afghanistan face hard choice of dividing their familiesAfghan girls determined to return to schoolMoreDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";Taliban special forces bring abrupt end to women's protest;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/womens-protest-taliban-special-forces-abrupt-end/;mindset;0.930000
"New Zealand authorities imprisoned a man inspired by the Islamic State group for three years after catching him with a hunting knife and extremist videos — but at a certain point despite grave fears he would attack others they say they could do nothing more to keep him behind bars.So for 53 days from July police tracked the man's every move an operation that involved some 30 officers working around the clock. Their fears were borne out Friday when he walked into an Auckland supermarket grabbed a kitchen knife from a store shelf andstabbedfive people critically injuring three.Two more shoppers were injured in the melee. On Saturday three of the victims remained hospitalized in critical condition and three more were in stable or moderate conditions. The seventh person was recovering at home. The youngest victim was a 29-year-old woman the oldest a 77-year-old man.Court documents named the man as 32-year-old Ahamed Aathil Mohamed Samsudeen a Tamil Muslim who arrived in New Zealand 10 years ago on a student visa seeking refugee status.Police keep watch outside the Countdown supermarket at Lynn Mall in Auckland on September 4 2021.DIEGO OPATOWSKI/AFP via Getty ImagesUndercover officers monitoring him from just outside the supermarket sprang into action when they saw shoppers running and heard shouting police said and shot him dead within a couple of minutes of him beginning his attack. A bystander's video records the sound of 10 shots being fired in rapid succession.The attack has highlighted deficiencies in New Zealand's anti-terror laws which experts say are too focused on punishing actions and inadequate for dealing with plots before they are carried out. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said lawmakers were close to filling some of those legislative holes when the attack occurred. She vowed law changes by the end of the month.Police Commissioner Andrew Coster said the law they were working under required a suspect to make the first move.""We might have an understanding of intent and ideology and we might have high levels of concern"" Coster said. ""But that is not sufficient for us to take any enforcement action.""Samsudeen was first noticed by police in 2016 when he started posting support for terror attacks and violent extremism on Facebook.Police twice confronted him but he kept on posting. In 2017 they arrested him at Auckland Airport. He was headed for Syria authorities say presumably to join the Islamic State insurgency. Police searches found he had a hunting knife and some banned propaganda material and he was later released on bail. In 2018 he bought another knife and police found two Islamic State videos.He spent the next three years in jail after pleading guilty to various crimes and for breaching bail. On new charges in May a jury found Samsudeen guilty on two counts of possessing objectionable videos both of which showed Islamic State group imagery including the group's flag and a man in a black balaclava holding a semi-automatic weapon.However the videos didn't show violent murders like some Islamic State videos and weren't classified as the worst kind of illicit material. High Court Judge Sally Fitzgerald described the contents as religious hymns sung in Arabic. She said the videos described obtaining martyrdom on the battlefield by being killed for God's cause.A court report warned Samsudeen had the motivation and means to commit violent acts in the community and posed a high risk. It described him as harboring extreme attitudes living an isolated lifestyle and having a sense of entitlement.But the judge decided to release him sentencing him to a year's supervision at an Auckland mosque where a leader had confirmed his willingness to help and support Samsudeen on his release.The judge said she rejected arguments Samsudeen had simply stumbled on the videos and was trying to improve his Arabic. She said an aggravating factor was that he was on bail for earlier similar offenses and had tried to delete his internet browser history.Fitzgerald noted the extreme concerns of police saying she didn't know if they were right but ""I sincerely hope they are not.""The judge also banned Samsudeen from owning any devices that could access the internet unless approved in writing by a probation officer and ordered that he provide access to any social media accounts he held.""I am of the view that the risk of you reoffending in a similar way to the charges upon which you were convicted remains high"" the judge concluded. ""Your rehabilitation is accordingly key.""Two months later Samsudeen took a train from a mosque in the Auckland suburb of Glen Eden where he was living to a Countdown supermarket in New Lynn tailed at a distance by police. He wheeled a shopping cart around the store like the other customers for about 10 minutes. The store was less crowded than normal due to coronavirus distancing requirements and undercover police were hanging back so as not to be noticed.At about 2:40 p.m. he began shouting ""Allahu akbar"" - meaning ""God is great"" - and started stabbing random shoppers sending people running and screaming unleashing an attack that shocked a nation.Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical advicePablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";Extremist was released from New Zealand jail despite fears;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-zealand-extremist-released-jail-despite-fears/;mindset;0.930000

"Great white shark attacks are rare and when they do occur they are sometimes fatal. But attacks against the human species are often a result of mistaken identity new research published on Tuesday shows.Thestudy published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface was conducted by looking at humans and animals from a great white shark's eye view below the ocean surface. It's often been assumed that it's hard for sharks to differentiate between them but there is little research taking into account how sharks see rather than just from their perspective from underwater.Sharks according to the research have limited color perception if they are not completely color blind and have spatial resolving power that is ""considerably worse than humans."" So when they are looking for prey researchers found they more heavily rely on motion and brightness contrast.To determine how great white sharks primarily juveniles since they are most often the ones involved in human interactions might see objects when looking up from below the ocean surface researchers specifically compared video footage of rectangular floats humans swimming humans paddling surfboards and pinnipeds including sea lions and seals. The footage was filtered to mimic the sharks' visual system.And as it turns out the researchers found that juvenile great whites cannot significantly differentiate between the different life forms. The silhouettes of the different objects at the surface are too similar for the animals given their reliance on motion and light.""From the perspective of a white shark...neither visual motion nor shape cues allow an unequivocal visual distinction between pinnipeds and humans"" the study says ""supporting the mistaken identity theory behind some bites.""Laura Ryan the lead author of the study said in apress releasefrom Macquarie University that surfers are the most at-risk for fatal shark bites particularly from juveniles.""We found that surfers swimmers and pinnipeds (seals and sea lions) on the surface of the ocean will look the same to a white shark looking up from below because these sharks can't see fine details or colours"" she said.Professor Nathan Hart senior author of the study said thatgreat whiteshave to learn what to eat and their diet changes as they grow and learn. This could explain why juvenile sharks tend to be more commonly involved in biting humans. Adult sharks researchers said tend to have better vision and can better differentiate.""They need to develop a search image for these prey items and combine that with other sensory information"" Hart said. ""It's a learning process that could be prone to mistakes.""The study was also conducted in a controlled pool setting rather than the ocean leading researchers to believe that the sharks' ability to differentiate between humans and prey is actually worse because of the lower visibility in oceans. They also believe that the mistaken identity theory could apply to other shark species associated with human fatalities such as tiger sharks or bull sharks.But researchers also urged people to remember that shark bites are rare. In 2020 there were 57 confirmed unprovokedshark attack casesworldwide according to the University of Florida's International Shark Attack File. The 2015 to 2019 average was 80 incidents every year.They also reiterated that sharks themselves are endangered. In January scientists announced that shark and ray populations havedeclined more than 70%over the past 50 years with overfishing being a main culprit. Fish nets and drum lines often placed under water to ward off the animals only further threaten the species and other marine life researchers of the great white study found.They hope their findings can help find better ways to prevent future shark bites and provide an overall better understanding of the creatures that are vital to marine ecosystems.""Understanding why shark bites occur can help us find ways to prevent them"" Ryan said ""while keeping both humans and sharks safer.""Direction and strength of motion cues from the 2DMD model of (a–c) a pinniped swimming (d–f) a human paddling a surfboard (g–i) a human swimming and (j–l) a rectangular float towed through the water.

The 2015 to 2019 average was 80 incidents every year.They also reiterated that sharks themselves are endangered. In January scientists announced that shark and ray populations havedeclined more than 70%over the past 50 years with overfishing being a main culprit. Fish nets and drum lines often placed under water to ward off the animals only further threaten the species and other marine life researchers of the great white study found.They hope their findings can help find better ways to prevent future shark bites and provide an overall better understanding of the creatures that are vital to marine ecosystems.""Understanding why shark bites occur can help us find ways to prevent them"" Ryan said ""while keeping both humans and sharks safer.""Direction and strength of motion cues from the 2DMD model of (a–c) a pinniped swimming (d–f) a human paddling a surfboard (g–i) a human swimming and (j–l) a rectangular float towed through the water.

"Moscow— Russia's government internet censors have threatened to hit Apple and Google with fines if they don't delete an app developed by jailed opposition leaderAlexey Navalny's team. The app urges Russian voters to defeat PresidentVladimir Putin's ruling party in the upcoming parliamentary elections.Navalny's movement was formallylabelled an ""extremist"" organizationby Russian authorities over the summer putting him and his supporters in the same ranks as al Qaeda and the Taliban in the eyes of Russian law. In February Navalny was immediately arrested upon return to Russia from Germany where he spent months recovering from a poisoning attack that he and U.S. officials accuse Putin himself of ordering.His jailing prompted mass protests across the country resulting in thousands of arrests.Putin critic Navalny appears in court01:29The censor Roskomnadzor told Apple and Google that the ""Smart Voting"" app must be deleted from its app stores citing the Navalny group behind it having been designated an extremist organization Interfax news agency reported on Thursday.If the companies fail to comply Moscow ""may also consider [it] as interference of the U.S. companies in Russian elections"" the article stated.As of Friday neither platform had deleted the app.Targeting dissent by fining big-techThe demands are just the latest test for Western tech giants as authorities in Moscow continue to demand compliance with controversial legislation that has given the Kremlin ever-growing control over the internet and everything on it within Russia's borders.Fines against Western internet companies have already piled up as many refuse to comply with new laws including the requirement that all Russian users' data be stored domestically on Russian servers and that service providers share decryption keys if Russia's special services ask for them so they can scrutinize encrypted user data.Facebook has already been slapped with nearly $600000 in fines followed by Google which owes about $383000 dollars thus far according to a report on internet freedoms in Russia done by the advocacy groupReporters Without Borders.The report says that in the run-up to the September parliamentary elections from which most opposition candidates have already been disqualified Russian authorities have significantly increased pressure on international online platforms.A visit to a Chinese ""detox"" center for video...03:11Reporters Without Borders notes that the bulk of penalties against internet services for ""involving minors in protest activity"" targeted Western technology platforms while other services such as China's TikTok and Russia's version of Facebook VKontakte were affected to a much lesser extent.Roskomsvoboda an internet freedom advocacy group said that over the past two years Russian authorities have increasingly used internet restrictions as ""a tool to combat opposition-minded information or socio-political sources"" and a means of surveillance.In July Roskomnadzor banned over 40 websites and services associated with Navalny's movement. In March the internet censor issued a warning to popular Virtual Private Network (VPN) services which allow Russians to access banned content to filter their traffic or risk being banned in the country.An overwhelming majority of services including NordVPN ProtonVPN TorGuard and others have refused citing privacy concerns.On Friday as President Putin addressed a business panel in Vladivostok with many foreign investors present via video link the censor announced that six popular VPNs would be blocked in Russia.Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks at a plenary session during the Eastern Economic Forum at Far Eastern Federal University September 3 2021 in Vladivostok Russia.Mikhail Svetlov/GettySome services are equipped to bypass the bans however and it wasn't immediately clear how effective the restrictions would be.Russia's internet regulators tried for two years without much luck to block the popular messaging app Telegram but ended up restoring full access. The authorities have also threatened in the past to ban Twitter but they seem to have opted to just slow down traffic on the site in what many see as a warning to platforms with far more users in the country like Google and Facebook.Putin has ""no time"" for techPutin has made ""digitalization"" one of the priorities of the Russia's economy. But the former spy also famously dislikes the internet has no presence on social networks himself and doesn't even own a cell phone.During a visit to an elementary school in the city of Vladivostok on Wednesday a boy asked Putin to sign up for his YouTube channel about ecology leaving the president confused.""What do I have to sign?"" Putin asked. ""I didn't understand — what must I sign?""His response prompted chuckles from the kids in the audience and the 10-year-old went on to explain that YouTube is a social media platform. (You can watch the exchangehere on YouTube.)""Ah okay"" Putin replied. ""To your channel? Okay I'll think about it.""The Kremlin commented on the exchange explaining that President Putin ""has no time to post on social media"" and doesn't want anyone to do it for him either.Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical advicePablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";Russia threatens Apple and Google with fines over Navalny team's app;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-apple-google-fine-threat-alexey-navalny-app/;mindset;0.930000

"Wellington New Zealand— New Zealand authorities were so worried about an Islamic extremist they were following him around-the-clock and were able to shoot and kill him within 60 seconds of him unleashing a frenzied knife attack that wounded six people Friday at an Auckland supermarket. Three of those stabbed were seriously injured.Police guard the area around a Countdown grocery store after an extremist carried out a terrorist attack stabbing six people before being shot by police on September 3 2021 in Auckland New Zealand.Fiona Goodall//GettyPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the incident was a terror attack. She said the man was a Sri Lankan national who was inspired by the Islamic State group (ISIS) and was well known to the nation's security agencies.Ardern said she had been personally briefed on the man in the past but there had been no legal reason for him to be detained.""Had he done something that would have allowed us to put him into prison he would have been in prison"" Ardern said.The attack unfolded at about 2:40 p.m. at a Countdown supermarket in New Zealand's largest city.Police Commissioner Andrew Coster said a police surveillance team and a special tactics group had followed the man from his home to the supermarket.But while they had grave ongoing concerns about the man they had no particular reason to think he was planning an attack on Friday Coster said. The man appeared to be going into the store to do his grocery shopping as he had in the past.""He entered the store as he had done before. He obtained a knife from within the store"" Coster said. ""Surveillance teams were as close as they possibly could be to monitor his activity.""Police escort people from LynnMall to their cars after an extremist stabbed six people before being shot by police on September 3 2021 in Auckland New Zealand.Fiona Goodall/GettyCoster said that when the commotion started two police from the special tactics group rushed over. He said the man approached police with the knife and so they shot and killed him.One bystander video taken from inside the supermarket records the sound of 10 shots being fired in rapid succession.Coster said there would be questions about whether police could have reacted even quicker. He said that the man was very aware of the constant surveillance and they needed to be some distance from him for it to be effective.Ardern said the attack was violent and senseless and she was sorry it had happened.""What happened today was despicable. It was hateful. It was wrong"" Ardern said. ""It was carried out by an individual. Not a faith not a culture not an ethnicity. But an individual person who is gripped by ideology that is not supported here by anyone or any community.""Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern speaks to the media at a press conference with the details of the Auckland supermarket terror attack at the Beehive Theatrette on September 3 2021 in Wellington New Zealand.ROBERT KITCHIN/GettyArdern said the man had first moved to New Zealand in 2011 and had been monitored by security agencies since 2016. She said authorities are confident he acted alone in the attack.Ardern said legal constraints prevented her from discussing everything that she wanted to about the case but she was hoping to have those constraints lifted soon.Some shoppers in the supermarket tried to help those who had been wounded by grabbing towels and diapers and whatever else they could find from the shelves.""To everyone who was there and who witnessed such a horrific event I can't imagine how they will be feeling in the aftermath"" Ardern said. ""But thank you for coming to the aid of those who needed you when they needed you.""Extremist ideology is rare in New Zealand and Ardern said that only a tiny number of people would be subject to such intense surveillance.Auckland is currently in a strict lockdown as it battles an outbreak of the coronavirus.

"Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said Friday he won't run for his ruling party's leadership effectively ending his tenure and throwing wide open the race for the next premier.The shocking decision after just a year in office comes with Suga's approval ratings at an all-time low over his government's handling of the response to thecoronavirus pandemic.And it suggests a possible return to political instability for Japan which cycled through prime ministers regularly before the lengthy tenure of Suga's predecessor Shinzo Abe.""In one year since I became prime minister I have poured all of my strength into dealing with the various problems facing the country with anti-coronavirus measures at the forefront"" Suga told reporters.He said he realized that running for election and handling the virus response would require ""enormous energy"".""I came to the realization that I cannot do both. I had to choose one of them"" he added.Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga speaks to media after announcing he was pulling out of the race for his party's leadership effectively meaning he won't seek re-election.Kyodo via ReutersLiberal Democratic Party (LDP) Secretary General Toshihiro Nikai said he was ""surprised"" by Suga's decision not to stand in the September 29 leadership race.""It's truly regrettable. He did his best"" Nikai said.It was a decision that hadn't been foreshadowed with Suga dropping no hints of his plans to leave office after just a single year in power and before contesting his first general election.He came to office last year stepping into the post left empty when Abe resigned for health reasons.Suga had been widely expected to seek re-election as LDP leader with most speculation surrounding only how soon after that he would call a general election.The election must be called by late October and held by the following month with the LDP expected to remain in power but possibly lose seats as a result of Suga's unpopularity.His government's approval rating has nosedived to an all-time low of 31.8 percent according to a poll by the Kyodo news agency last month.And recent reports about his plans for a cabinet reshuffle as an attempt to remedy his unpopularity appeared to be insufficient.His decision was likely to be privately welcomed by some in the party said Tomoaki Iwai a professor of politics at Nihon University.""For the LDP MPs it's a relief that they don't have to run in general elections under an unpopular prime minister"" he told AFP.Suga has been battered by his government's response to the pandemic with Japan struggling through a record fifth wave of the virus after a slow start of its vaccine rollout.Much of the country is currently under virus restrictions and the measures have been in place in some areas for almost the entire year.But they have been insufficient to stop a surge in cases driven by the more contagious Delta variant even as vaccination has picked up pace with nearly 43 percent of the population fully inoculated.Japan has recorded nearly 16000 deaths during the pandemic.The 72-year-old Suga's rise to prime minister last year capped a lengthy political career.Before taking the top office he served in the prominent role of chief cabinet secretary and had earned a fearsome reputation for wielding his power to control Japan's sprawling and powerful bureaucracy.The son of a strawberry farmer and a school teacher Suga was raised in rural Akita in northern Japan and put himself through college after moving to Tokyo by working at a factory.He was elected to his first office in 1987 as a municipal assembly member in Yokohama outside Tokyo and entered parliament in 1996.The news of Suga's announcement cheered investors causing the benchmark Nikkei index to gain 1.70 percent after the lunch break.Analysts said investors expected a change in leadership to boost the chances of an economic stimulus package.One of Suga's challengers for head of the LDP is Fumio Kishida who has already pledged to spend big if elected and Iwai said the former foreign minister would now be in good shape.""Kishida is probably the front runner as he is moderate and capable"" Iwai said.The turmoil makes it likely the election will be pushed back as late as possible into November he added.Coronavirus CrisisMoreUnited says unvaccinated workers cost it millions of dollarsFDA advisers back Pfizer's COVID vaccine for kids 5 to 11Can I get a booster shot?

""We need to do everything that we can to protect them to get them to a safe situation.""The airport suicide bombing was carried out by Islamic State militants who are sworn rivals of the Taliban. The U.S. military has acknowledged that during the airlift it was coordinating to some extent with the Taliban who set up checkpoints around the airport for crowd control and in the final days facilitated the evacuation of American citizens.The Taliban have tried to present a new image promising amnesty to former opponents and saying they would form an inclusive government. Many Afghans don't trust those promises fearing the Taliban will quickly resort to the brutal tactics of their 1996-2001 rule including barring girls and women from schools and jobs. The Taliban have been vague on their policy toward women so far but have not yet issued sweeping repressive edicts.Most members of the Afghan women's team formed in 2007 were evacuated to Australia last week.But the girls ages 14-16 and their families also could be targeted by the Taliban - not just because women and girls are forbidden to play sports but because they were advocates for girls and active members of their communities said Farkhunda Muhtaj who is captain of the Afghanistan women's national team and lives in Canada.""They are devastated. They're hopeless considering the situation they're in"" said Muhtaj who keeps in contact with the girls and urges them to stay calm.There have been at least five failed attempts to rescue the girls in recent days as they were moved around for their safety McCreary and Muhtaj said. They were ""footsteps from freedom"" when the suicide bombing occurred Muhtaj said.Complicating the rescue effort is the size of the group - 133 people including the 26 youth team members as well as adults and other children including infants. Many don't have passports or other necessary documentation to board flights from Kabul.McCreary said the mission - called Operation Soccer Balls - is working with other countries with the hope the girls will eventually settle in the U.S. He said Australia France and Qatar have expressed interest in helping. He also urged the Taliban to ease the exit for the group saying it would create goodwill.""If we can put a protective bubble around these women and young girls ... I really believe the world will stand up and take notice and have a lot of offers to take them in and host them"" McCreary said.Former U.S. women's national soccer team captain Julie Foudy a two-time World Cup champion and two-time Olympic gold medalist said the rescue efforts ""raise the visibility of these young women and their importance to equality and democracy and all these things that we value in this country.""""As many of us who can stand up as female athletes - as humans - and say 'This is a moment we need to come together and do what's right' then we absolutely should"" she said.Nic McKinley a CIA and Air Force veteran who founded Dallas-based DeliverFund a nonprofit that's secured housing for 50 Afghan families said he understood that the U.S. was focused on relocating Afghans who helped American forces but that others need help too.""What about the little girl who just wants to kick a ball around a field and wants to do that well and has worked hard to do that at a world class level who finds herself suddenly in jeopardy only because she just wanted to play a sport and had a passion for playing that sport?"" he said. ""The only thing that they had done wrong in the eyes of the Taliban ... is the fact that they were born girls and they had the audacity to dream of doing something.""McCreary said the rescue team feels personally responsible because the U.S. helped the girls go to school and play soccer.""We need to protect them now"" he said. ""They should not be in harm's way for things that we helped them do.""Afghanistan: The New RealityMoreISIS-K could be able to launch attacks out of Afghanistan within a year: DOD officialHumanitarian crisis surges under Taliban ruleFormer chief negotiator for U.S. Zalmay Khalilzad sticks by his Taliban dealAmericans in Afghanistan face hard choice of dividing their familiesAfghan girls determined to return to schoolMoreDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";"Effort underway to rescue ""hopeless"" girls soccer team from Afghanistan";https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/afghanistan-national-girls-soccer-team-rescue-efforts/;mindset;0.930000

"Great white shark attacks are rare and when they do occur they are sometimes fatal. But attacks against the human species are often a result of mistaken identity new research published on Tuesday shows.Thestudy published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface was conducted by looking at humans and animals from a great white shark's eye view below the ocean surface. It's often been assumed that it's hard for sharks to differentiate between them but there is little research taking into account how sharks see rather than just from their perspective from underwater.Sharks according to the research have limited color perception if they are not completely color blind and have spatial resolving power that is ""considerably worse than humans."" So when they are looking for prey researchers found they more heavily rely on motion and brightness contrast.To determine how great white sharks primarily juveniles since they are most often the ones involved in human interactions might see objects when looking up from below the ocean surface researchers specifically compared video footage of rectangular floats humans swimming humans paddling surfboards and pinnipeds including sea lions and seals. The footage was filtered to mimic the sharks' visual system.And as it turns out the researchers found that juvenile great whites cannot significantly differentiate between the different life forms.

"Malaysian shot putter Muhammad Ziyad Zolkefli appeared to have won gold in the shot put in the F20 class at the Paralympics Games in Tokyo. But after the victory on Tuesday he was disqualified because he had shown up late for the competition.International Paralympic Committee spokesman Craig Spence said Zolkefli and two others - who did not reach the podium - were allowed to compete under protest after they failed to appear on time for the event.""They were late they may have had a logical reason for being late and therefore we allowed them to compete and look at the facts of the matter afterward"" Spence said.In this Tuesday Aug. 31 2021 file photo Muhammad Ziyad Zolkefli of Malaysia reacts after competing in the men's shot put F20 final during the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics Games at the National Stadium in Tokyo.Eugene Hoshiko / APAstatement from World Para Athletics which governs track and field for Para sports said a referee had determined after the event that ""there was no justifiable reason for the athletes' failure to report"" on time. It said an appeal was also turned down.The disqualification bumped Maksym Koval of Ukraine up to gold and Ukraine teammate Oleksandr Yarovyi took silver. Bronze went to Efstratios Nikolaidis of Greece.Spence said the disqualification was met with anger on social media. He described it as ""very abusive."" Much of it targeted the Ukrainians.""We are now seeing comments on all our social media posts that have nothing to do with the men's shot put F20 event"" Spence said. He said the Ukrainian Paralympic Committee ""was getting a lot of abuse from Malaysians.""""I'm sorry. Rules are rules"" Spence said. ""The decision was taken. It wasn't the Ukrainians fault that the Malaysian was late.""Spence said the three had arrived three minutes late. He said he did not see this as a harsh penalty. ""Others get there five minutes early"" he said.Spence said an excuse given was that the Malaysian and the two others said they ""didn't hear the announcement or it was in a language"" they did not understand.The F20 class in shot put is for athletes with intellectual disabilities.The Associated Press attempted to reach the Malaysian delegation through an email address provided by IPC officials. There was no immediate response on Wednesday.Early in 2019 the IPC stripped Malaysia of the World Para Swimming Championships for being unwilling to guarantee that Israeli athletes could compete.Spence said the reaction then was similar.""The level of abuse that was directed at the IPC then was through the roof"" Spence said.Tokyo OlympicsMoreOlympic cyclist says she was pregnant when she won silver medalIOC suspends North Korea from next Olympics for skipping Tokyo GamesAfghan flag displayed during Paralympics opening ceremonyOlympian auctions off medal to help pay for infant's heart surgeryAshleigh Johnson on Olympic gold diversity in aquatic sportsMoreDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";Paralympian stripped of gold medal for being 3 minutes late;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tokyo-paralympics-muhammad-ziyad-zolkefli-stripped-gold-medal-3-minutes-late/;mindset;0.930000

""I don't know whether there will be a review or not but certainly there was a lot of deception perhaps on the part of the new authorities [of Afghanistan].

In doing so he said he was quoting German Chancellor Angela Merkel whom he called ""one of the great figures of world democracy."" However he was inadvertently paraphrasing remarks made by Russian PresidentVladimir Putin.""'It is necessary to put an end to the irresponsible policy of intervening from outside and building democracy in other countries ignoring the traditions of the peoples.'

"Afghan Paralympians Hossain Rasouli andZakia Khudadadifeared they would miss the Tokyo Paralympics when the Taliban takeover ofAfghanistaninitially prevented them from flying to Tokyo. But after a harrowing few weeks filled with uncertainty and doubt Rasouli finally got his chance to compete in the Games on Tuesday afterescaping his homelandlast week.Rasouli whose left hand was amputated as a result of a mine explosion was still able to represent Afghanistan at the Paralympics despite missing the event he had qualified for. The 26-year-old trained primarily to be a sprinter for the 100-meter dash but he instead competed in the T47 long jump where he finished in last place.International Paralympic Committee   spokesperson Craig Spence said that Rasouli had been ""super excited"" to compete and called it a ""special occasion"" for him.Afghanistan's Hossain Rasouli reacts after being eliminated from the Men's Long Jump T47 Final at Olympic Stadium during day seven of the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games in Japan.John Walton/PA Images via Getty ImagesThe last few weeks have been a whirlwind for Rasouli and Khudadadi. Earlier this month the IPC said that Afghanistan's National Paralympic Committee would not participate in the Tokyo Paralympics because they couldn't grab a flight out of the country. The Paralympics even displayed theAfghan flag in ""a show of solidarity""during the opening ceremony despite the team not having a representative present.However following desperate pleas from Khudadadi both she and Rasouli were evacuated from Kabul and arrived in Tokyo on Saturday. They had been sequestered in the Paralympic Village for privacy and safety reasons until Tuesday when Rasouli competed.On Monday IPC president Andrew Parson told reporters that welcoming the two Afghan athletes was his personal ""best moment"" of the Games. He promised that the IPC would ""provide everything in our capacity"" to ensure ""the safest"" and ""calmest"" environment for them.A day earlier Spence said the players' well-being is their priority and would not grant media access to the athletes.""Human life is the most important thing here... This is about these athletes fulfilling their dream of being able to attend the Paralympic Games"" Spence said.Khudadadi meanwhile is set to become Afghanistan's first ever female Paralympian when she competes on Thursday. The 23-year-old will compete in the K44 taekwondo category.

"A dozen child and teenage female musicians inAfghanistanare in ""grave danger"" from the Taliban and need to be rescued after theU.S. withdrew its militaryfrom the country according to Rage Against The Machine guitarist Tom Morello.The girls ranging in age from 4 to 19 are members of a school called Girl With a Guitar a music school in Kabul founded by Lanny Cordola a songwriter producer and guitarist for bands such as Giuffria and House of Lords. On Monday Morello wrote an open letter to the music community asking it to help Cordola get the girls and their families out of Afghanistan.""I'm writing on behalf of some very special girls in Afghanistan who are in grave danger"" Morello wrote in the letter which Cordola sent toBillboard. ""[Girl With a Guitar] takes in street orphans and other girls that have endured significant trauma and uses music as a rehabilitation tool and means of working through their problems their histories and their hopes.""""I've had the honor of collaborating with these wonderful kids. Since the Taliban takeover their school has been destroyed and the girls are in hiding"" Morello continued. ""They are at extreme risk because they are widely known to have performed Western music and have been educated by a male American teacher. Anything you could do to help save their lives would be much appreciated.""Cordola is in Pakistan trying to find a way to evacuate the girls. He had flown back to the U.S. to get his visa renewed when the Taliban took over Afghanistan.""These are my little babies"" Cordola said in an interview with CBS News. ""We always talk about staying calm but inside I'm freaking out. ... I kind of vacillate between sadness and outrage and shock. ... I'm concerned that these beasts will get their hands on them.""Cordola's primary concern is the safety of the girls. Just before he spoke with CBS News on Tuesday he said he spoke with a well-known Afghan musician who had just been attacked by the Taliban at his house. Cordola said the Taliban went to the musician's house Monday night and ""tore his place apart.""The students have had a ""hard time grasping"" the situation in Afghanistan Cordola said. He speaks with his students daily he said and has had to explain to them that ""the old Afghanistan that you know is dead.""""They tell me that every night there's been gunfights between 1 and 4 o'clock in the morning"" Cordola told CBS News.Referencing the song ""I Won't Back Down"" Cordola said ""I'll stand at the gates of hell and won't back down until we get all these girls out.""Girl With a Guitar which is a part of Cordola's nonprofit The Miraculous Love Kids came to fruition in 2015 after Cordola met an 8-year-old girl who had survived an attack by a Taliban suicide bomber. Two of her sisters died in the attack.""I brought a guitar with me and basically she just jumped right into the heart here"" Cordola said adding that she then asked him to become her teacher. ""When an 8-year-old war-torn Afghan girl who just lost her two sisters asks you to be their guitar teacher you can't say no to that.""Girl With a Guitar has closed since the Taliban took over. It operated out of Kabul where the girls learned English life skills and music and received a stipend.

It's often been assumed that it's hard for sharks to differentiate between them but there is little research taking into account how sharks see rather than just from their perspective from underwater.Sharks according to the research have limited color perception if they are not completely color blind and have spatial resolving power that is ""considerably worse than humans."" So when they are looking for prey researchers found they more heavily rely on motion and brightness contrast.To determine how great white sharks primarily juveniles since they are most often the ones involved in human interactions might see objects when looking up from below the ocean surface researchers specifically compared video footage of rectangular floats humans swimming humans paddling surfboards and pinnipeds including sea lions and seals. The footage was filtered to mimic the sharks' visual system.And as it turns out the researchers found that juvenile great whites cannot significantly differentiate between the different life forms.

See where COVID-19 restrictions permit itThe EU also removed Israel Kosovo Lebanon Montenegro and North Macedonia from the list.The EU has no unified COVID-19 tourism policy and national EU governments have the authority to decide whether they keep their borders open to U.S. tourists. Possible restrictions could include quarantines further testing requirements upon arrival or even a total ban on all nonessential travel from the U.S.More than 15 million Americans a year visited Europe before the coronavirus crisis and new travel restrictions could cost Europe billions.The recommendation doesn't apply to Britain which formally left the EU at the beginning of the year and opened its borders to fully vaccinated travelers from the U.S. earlier this month.The United States remains on Britain's ""amber"" travel list meaning that fully vaccinated adults arriving from the U.S. to the U.K. don't have to self-isolate. A COVID-19 test is required three days before arrival in the U.K. and another test is needed two days after arriving.Meanwhile the United States has yet to reopen its own borders to EU tourists despite calls from the bloc for the Biden administration to lift its ban. Adalbert Jahnz the European Commission spokesperson for home affairs said Monday that the EU's executive arm remained in discussions with the U.S. administration as both sides have so far failed to find a reciprocal approach.In addition to the epidemiological criteria used to determine the countries for which restrictions should be lifted the European Council said that ""reciprocity should also be taken into account on a case by case basis.""The European Council updates the safe travel list based on criteria relating to coronavirus infection levels. It gets reviewed every two weeks. The threshold for being on the EU list is having not more than 75 new COVID-19 cases per 100000 inhabitants over the last 14 days.Last week in the U.S. new coronavirus cases averaged over 152000 a day turning the clock back to the end of January and the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients was around 85000 a number not seen since early February.U.S. coronavirus deaths have been over 1200 a day for several days seven times higher than they were in early July.Coronavirus CrisisMoreUnited says unvaccinated workers cost it millions of dollarsFDA advisers back Pfizer's COVID vaccine for kids 5 to 11Can I get a booster shot?

The restaurant's owner said he was bombarded by death threats from a nationalist hate group and forced to take down the advertisement.Yobidoyobi which has stores in 65 Russian cities posted its first ad featuring a Black model — a man surrounded by three women with Slavic features — on August 14. It followed up on the campaign two weeks later posting another picture of the same man easting sushi and the chain's social media accounts were quickly flooded with hateful comments.A photo used by Russia sushi restaurant chain Yobidoyobi which the chain's founder said had been taken down due to a backlash against the use of a Black model.Yobidoyobi founder Konstantin Zimen attributed the attacks to a hate group called ""Male State"" and said the barrage of threats came after the movement's leader Vladislav Pozdnyakov shared the chain's ad on his accounts.Male State and Pozdnyakov which describes itself as a movement promoting ""traditional values"" in Russia have previously threatened Russian women with biracial children LGBTQ and feminist activists and others.Russia court overturns transgender woman's ""pornography"" convictionThe group boasts on its social media pages of having over 100000 members.

Many brands use images of different models which may differ in skin color gender and so on"" Zimen told the Inc. Russia outlet. ""There was no provocation in this — it is just the voice of the times.

"North Korea appears to have restarted its biggest nuclear reactor after more than two years the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency said ina reportpublished late last week calling it a ""deeply troubling"" development. The International Atomic Energy Agency called the isolated country's nuclear program ""a cause for serious concern"" and pointed specifically to ""new indications of the operation"" of the 5-megawatt Yongbyon reactor as ""deeply troubling.""The agency said that any continuation of the North's nuclear program was ""a clear violation of relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions and is deeply regrettable.""Dictator Kim Jong Un rolled back some of his country's nuclear work during negotiations with former President Donald Trump but that dialogue broke down after Mr. Trump held two face-to-face summits with Kim butfailed to make any real headway. Both sides accused the other of standing in the way of progress.With thecoronaviruspandemic occupying President Biden's agenda from Day 1 of his administration and thefall of Afghanistanto the Taliban more recently North Korea had fallen largely out of the headlines from White House press briefings.North Korea tests Biden administration15:09But the Kim regime welcomed Mr. Biden to office with a very early message: North Korea test-fired twoshort-range ballistic missilesin March just hours before Mr. Biden gave hisfirst solo news conferenceas president. The test saw North Korea fire what it claimed were a ""new-type tactical guided projectiles.""Mr. Biden confirmed that the projectiles were ballistic missiles and thus a violation of the myriad U.N. sanctions that bar North Korea from testing such weapons and from nuclear enrichment work.The president said at the time that he considered North Korea his top foreign policy challenge and one on which he was consulting continuously with America's allies and partners as the White House sought to craft a new policy on the threat.""There will be responses if they choose to escalate"" Mr. Biden said in March. ""We will respond accordingly. But I'm also prepared for some form of diplomacy but it has to be conditioned upon the end result of denuclearization.""Far from denuclearization however with work seen at the Yongbyon nuclear power plant North Korea appeared to be ramping steadily back up.North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear facility is seen in a February 11 2020 file image provided by Maxar and 38North.DigitalGlobe/ScapeWare3d/Reuters""There were no indications of reactor operation from early December 2018 to the beginning of July 2021. However since early July 2021 there have been indications including the discharge of cooling water consistent with the operation of the reactor"" the IAEA report said.The Yongbyon 5MW reactor is North Korea's largest and it has the capacity to enrich both uranium and plutonium to weapons-grade purity. While the reactor is ostensibly used to generate power it is thought to be capable of producing enough weapons-grade plutonium to build a warhead in one year and even more weapons-grade uranium.North Korea kicked IAEA inspectors out of the country in 2009 leaving the global agency ""unable to carry out verification activities"" there. In its latest report the IAEA acknowledged that ""its knowledge of the DPRK's [North Korea's] nuclear program is limited and as further nuclear activities take place in the country this knowledge is declining.""North Korea is last known to have tested a nuclear device in 2017.The Kim regime has shown no interest in accepting overtures from the Biden administration to restart direct negotiations over North Korea's nuclear program insisting that the U.S. must change its policy first.North Korea launches missile01:38In the meantime work at the facilities that used to be monitored by the IAEA in North Korea can be assessed only by satellite imagery.""There has been no agreement governing these facilities for a long time now"" Joshua Pollack a researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies told the Reuters news agency.

"Rockets were launched toward Kabul's international airport on Monday morning as the U.S. withdrawal fromAfghanistanentered what President Biden has said will be its second-to-last day. There was no immediate word on who fired the projectiles none of which hit Hamid Karzai International Airport in the capital.White House press secretary Jen Psaki issued a statement saying Mr. Biden had been briefed ""on the rocket attack"" and ""was informed that operations continue uninterrupted at HKIA and has reconfirmed his order that commanders redouble their efforts to prioritize doing whatever is necessary to protect our forces on the ground.""Biden honors troops killed in Afghanistan as remains repatriatedWitnesses told The Associated Press that some of the rockets had slammed down in Kabul's Salim Karwan neighborhood less than two miles from the airport.

Rockets flew across the Afghan capital as the U.S. raced to complete its withdrawal from Afghanistan with the evacuation of civilians all but over and terror attack fears high.WAKIL KOHSAR/AFP via Getty ImagesAt least five rockets were fired in the attack U.S. officials told CBS News and some may have been intercepted by a close-range missile defense system but it was unclear if they were intercepted or just failed to reach their intended target. There were no initial reports of casualties.The attempted rocket attack came one day afterthe U.S. conducted an airstrike against an ISIS-K vehicle laden with explosivesnear the airport. It was the second such strike against the militant group since adeadly attack against U.S. forceslast week.U.S. Navy Captain Bill Urban a Central Command spokesman said in a statement that the strike was carried out by a drone and eliminated ""an imminent ISIS-K threat"" to Hamid Karzai International Airport.Urban initially said there were no suspected civilian casualties but CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata said Taliban officials and Afghan media were reporting that the blast had killed nine civilians including a number of small children.The Pentagon later acknowledged that there could have been civilian casualties. Urban said Central Command was aware of the reports and that the U.S. military was ""still assessing the results of this strike.""Rocket launchers are seen inside a destroyed vehicle in Kabul Afghanistan on August 30 2021. Rockets struck a neighborhood near Kabul's international airport amid the ongoing U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.

""It is unclear what may have happened and we are investigating further.""""We would be deeply saddened by any potential loss of innocent life"" he said in a statement.A defense official told CBS News there was uncertainty over whether the strike destroyed a car bomb or killed a suicide bomber riding in the car. Initial reports indicated that the car was carrying a suicide bomber but the size of the secondary explosion has convinced some analysts that it was a fully loaded car bomb.A defense official said the strike was ordered after two men were seen loading explosives into the trunk of a car. The car was hit by a Hellfire missile which produced a small explosion followed by a much larger secondary explosion.Bilal Karimi a senior aid to the Taliban's spokesman said the airstrike hit the vehicle near the airport. He said three suspected individuals were in the vehicle at the time of the strike. Karimi said the U.S military had told the Taliban that a vehicle full of explosives would arrive in Kabul and that the U.S. would destroy it.Biden commemorates 13 service members killed ...03:15Last week's attack on the Abbey Gate at the Kabul airport left at least 170 people dead including13 U.S. service members. U.S. officials have said a member of ISIS-K carried out the bombing and vowed to retaliate against those responsible.The gate hit by the massive deadly explosion last week had been due to be closed officials told CBS News but it was kept open as British troops in a hotel several hundred yards away decided they were going to go back to the airport as part of withdrawal. But the suicide bomber got there first.A U.S. airstrike on Friday the first since the attackkilledtwo ""high-profile"" ISIS-K planners and facilitators and wounded another according to Pentagon officials.Sunday morning's strike came after the State Department issued an alert warning people not to come to the airport because of a ""specific credible threat"" — a similar warning to one issued just hours before the devastating blast at Abbey Gate last week.The operations against ISIS-K militants come as the U.S. rushes to evacuate Americans and Afghan allies from the city ahead of President Biden's withdrawal deadline of August 31. As D'Agata reported it's one of the largest airlifts in U.S. history and it was in its final hours with American forces focused on getting themselves out of Afghanistan safely after helping more than 120000 civilians escape.Those who didn't make it to the airport have been making a break for the border of neighboring countries including Pakistan and Iran by the hundreds of thousands.Sullivan guarantees ""safe passage"" for U.S. c...08:53The State Department said there may be some American citizens who don't make the deadline to flee from the airport along with thousands of Afghans who have been granted U.S. visas who will also be left behind.But National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told Ed O'Keefe on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that the Taliban won't stop those people from leaving after the Tuesday deadline.""The Taliban have both communicated privately and publicly that they will allow for safe passage"" Sullivan said. ""We're not just going to take their word for it.""He said there would be ""significant consequences"" if Afghanistan's new rulers don't follow through with their commitment — and not just economic and diplomatic consequences but other capabilities that he said could be ""brought to bear.""Mr. Biden vowed to retaliate against those who facilitated Thursday's deadly attack.""We will not forgive. We will not forget.

"Cranes are installed at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris on Tuesday August 24 2021 as workers prepare the famed Paris monument for the project called ""L'Arc de Triomphe Wrapped"" by late artist Christo who wished this project to be continued after his death.Adrienne Surprenant / APThe Arc de Triomphe has seen parades protests and tourists galore but never before has the war monument in Paris been wrapped in silver and blue recyclable polypropylene fabric. That's about to happen next month in a posthumous art installation designed by artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude.""Christo has wrapped museums parliaments as in Germany but a monument like this? Not really. This is the first time. This is the first monument of this importance and scale that he has done"" Vladimir Yavachev the late collaborating couple's nephew told The Associated Press.Preparations have already started on the Napoleon-era arch where workers are covering statues to protect them from the wrapping.The idea for ""L'Arc de Triomphe Wrapped"" was formed in 1961 when Christo and Jeanne-Claude lived in Paris. Jeanne-Claude died in 2009 and in spite of Christo's death in May 2020 the project carried on.""He wanted to complete this project. He made us promise him that we will do it"" Yavachev told The Associated Press.It was to be realized last fall but theCOVID-19 pandemicdelayed the installation.The 14 million-euro ($16.4 million) project is being self-financed through the sale of Christo's preparatory studies drawings scale models and other pieces of work Yavachev said.Visitors to the foot of the Arc de Triomphe during the installation scheduled for September 18 to October 3 will be able to touch the fabric and those climbing to the top will step on it when they reach the roof terrace as intended by the artists.Visitors watch a video on ""L'Arc de Triomphe Wrapped"" in Paris on Tuesday August 24 2021.Adrienne Surprenant / APBorn in Bulgaria in 1935 Christo Vladimirov Javacheff met Jeanne-Claude Denat de Guillebon born in Morocco on the exact same day as him in Paris in 1958.The artists were known for elaborate temporary creations that involved blanketing familiar public places with fabric such as Berlin's Reichstag and Paris' Pont Neuf bridge and creating giant site-specific installations such as a series of 7503 gates in New York City's Central Park and the 24.5-mile ""Running Fence"" in California.Yavachev plans on completing another one of his uncle and aunt's unfinished projects: a 150-meter-tall (492 feet) pyramid-like mastaba in Abu Dhabi.""We have the blueprints we just have to do it"" he said.Trending News96-year-old woman on trial in Germany for suspected Nazi war crimesQueen Elizabeth pulls out of climate summit following medical advicePablo Escobar's ""cocaine hippos"" are legally people U.S. judge rulesSome women report being drugged with needles at U.K. nightclubsGreat white shark bites a case of mistaken identity study showsDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";Arc de Triomphe to be wrapped in fabric for $16.4 million art project;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/arc-de-triomphe-to-be-wrapped-for-posthumous-work-by-christo/;mindset;0.930000

It's often been assumed that it's hard for sharks to differentiate between them but there is little research taking into account how sharks see rather than just from their perspective from underwater.Sharks according to the research have limited color perception if they are not completely color blind and have spatial resolving power that is ""considerably worse than humans."" So when they are looking for prey researchers found they more heavily rely on motion and brightness contrast.To determine how great white sharks primarily juveniles since they are most often the ones involved in human interactions might see objects when looking up from below the ocean surface researchers specifically compared video footage of rectangular floats humans swimming humans paddling surfboards and pinnipeds including sea lions and seals. The footage was filtered to mimic the sharks' visual system.And as it turns out the researchers found that juvenile great whites cannot significantly differentiate between the different life forms.

In an interview on CBSN an Afghan interpreter who was there when the first blast went off described the chaotic aftermath as he attempted to save a baby girl who was caught in the explosion.The man whom CBS News is identifying only as Carl for his safety said he was at the airport trying to ""get on a plane and get the hell out of here."" He said there was a crowd of people trying to submit their paperwork to get into the airport and get a spot on an evacuation flight.After being told he had to wait an hour before he could be checked in Carl said he went back to his truck which was parked near the airport. That's when the explosion happened near the airport's Abbey Gate one of four main entrances.Three sources have told CBS News that a suicide bomber was responsible for the Abbey Gate explosion. A short time later a second bombing occurred at a nearby hotel.""A lot of people got hurt. People were laying on the ground"" Carl told CBS News' Vladimir Duthiers.That's when he said he noticed a baby girl among the wounded. He said he picked up the child and took her to his truck to take her to the hospital.""There was a lot of traffic. I had to get out and pick her up again"" he said.

"The U.S. and Britain have warned citizens not to go to Kabul's airport citing a terror threat to the sprawling facility outside of which thousands of desperate people have gathered since the Taliban's retaking of Afghanistan. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul sent out an alert on Wednesday evening advising U.S. citizens inAfghanistanto avoid traveling to the airport citing an unspecified security threat amid frantic efforts to evacuate Americans and vulnerable Afghans.""Because of security threats outside the gates of Kabul airport we are advising U.S. citizens to avoid traveling to the airport and to avoid airport gates at this time unless you receive individual instructions from a U.S. government representative to do so"" thesecurity alertread. ""U.S. citizens who are at the Abbey Gate East Gate or North Gate now should leave immediately.""A U.S. defense official told CBS News national security correspondent David Martin on Thursday that the threat was not to planes taking off or landing but of an explosive device being detonated outside the airport gates. The same official and others in Washington denied reports that evacuation efforts from Kabul — which have been enabled entirely by American forces controlling the Kabul airport — were set to end within 36 hours.It wasn't immediately clear what specific intelligence prompted the U.S. embassy's advisory but President Biden warned this week of the ongoing threat posed by the ISIS affiliate in Afghanistan ISIS Khorosan or ISIS-K. A senior British official did indicate that ISIS-K was behind the latest urgent threat in Kabul. The Taliban has vowed not to allow ISIS-K which has fought the much larger group for years in Afghanistan to continue operating inside the country.Britain urged its nationals and everyone else to avoid the airport on Thursday with the head of the army citing ""very very credible"" intelligence that terrorists were planning an imminent attack on the thousands of people who have gathered just outside the airport walls.Rush to finish Afghanistan evacuations06:23""There is now very very credible reporting of an imminent attack and hence why the Foreign Office advice was changed last night that people should not come to Kabul Airport they should move to a safe place and await further instructions"" British Armed Forces Minister James Heappey told BBC radio. ""I can't stress the desperation of the situation enough. The threat is credible it is imminent it is lethal. We wouldn't be saying this if we weren't genuinely concerned about offering Islamic State a target that is just unimaginable.""Heappey told Britain's Sky News on Thursday that the terror group was ""acutely aware of the fact that there is a closing window for people to leave [Kabul]. That is concentrating people in towards the airport and that is giving them an opportunity to do something that they would regard as spectacular — we would regard as absolutely abhorrent.""He said he knew the warning to avoid the airport would cause ""real desperation for many of the people who are yet to be brought out of the country but we're not being overly cautious: The threat whilst I can't give you the detail is very imminent very credible very lethal.""The U.S. Embassy in Kabul warned Americans to be aware of their surroundings at all times follow the instructions of local authorities have contingency plans in case of emergencies monitor local media and follow the State Department on social media.Top U.S. diplomat in Afghanistan on evacuatio...03:21The Biden administration has ramped up the pace of evacuations of U.S. citizens and at-risk Afghans from Kabul in recent days.

They're so desperate they don't even know what documentation they need to bring what he process is — so it's not going to make a difference to the crowds that are turning up.""President Biden on Tuesday said thatcontingency plansto meet his August 31 deadline for withdrawing all remaining U.S. forces from Afghanistan which will bring an end to the two-decade war there were being developed. However that deadline does not signal an end to America's ""involvement"" in the country according to Ross Wilson the acting U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan.""We would like for all those who wish to get out of this country to do so and to be able to do so by August 31 especially American citizens""Wilson told ""CBS Evening News"" anchor Norah O'Donnellin an exclusive interview Wednesday.""Our commitment in this country and our involvement in this country doesn't end on that date.

"Last summer Russia reached 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit — the highest temperature ever measured within the Arctic Circle according to an annual climate report released Wednesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. With help from a record-breaking concentration of carbon dioxide on the planet the Arctic's surface air temperature broke a 121-year record in 2020.""Today scientists sounded the alarm on the climate crisis again"" Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson chair of the House Committee on Science Space and Technology said in astatementregarding the report. ""It is clear that without swift action we can unfortunately expect to set new records like these every year.""The 31st annualState of the Climate report published by the American Meteorological Society and led by the NOAA is based on work from over 530 scientists in more than 60 different countries. It confirmed 2020 was among the three warmest years in recorded history. Despite a 6% to 7% reduction of carbon dioxide emissions as a result of the pandemic shutdowns carbon dioxide emissions reached its highest level of concentration at the planet's surface in at least the last 800000 years.""This is a stark reminder that factors leading to a changing climate are determined by time horizons far longer than a single year and have an inertia that will take a significant effort over a much longer period to halt much less reverse"" the report said.The year-over-year increase in global carbon dioxide levels over the past half century has tripled resulting in above-average temperatures across the world the report found.In Siberia — just north of the Arctic Circle — record temperatures led to quick snowmelt. In fact the entire Eurasian continent saw its fourth-smallest snow cover extent in May of last year and its record smallest in June.Siberia which is usually one of the coldest areas in the world also reported itsworst fire year as measured by the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. Wildfires have become more common in the area over the past five years with the number of fires increasing each year. Several weeks agosmoke from its wildfiresreached the North Pole for the first time in history.This photo taken from an airplane on July 27 2021 shows the smoke rising from a forest fire outside the village of Berdigestyakh in the republic of Sakha Siberia.DIMITAR DILKOFF/AFP via Getty ImagesMeanwhile ""extreme warmth"" reached Antarctica in 2020 as an atmospheric river brought unprecedented temperatures to the continent the report found.On February 6 2020 Esperanza Station — located on the Antarctic Peninsula — reached its highest temperature ever recorded at 64.94 degrees Fahrenheit. The heat brought the largest end of summer surface melt in 43 years which impacted more than half of the Peninsula.The year 2020 also saw the highest global sea levels highest average ocean heat content and most tropical cyclones ever recorded.Earlier this month the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said theimpacts of climate changeare ""extreme"" and ""unprecedented"" and it's expected to get worse ""unless deep reductions in carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gas emissions occur in the coming decades.""U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said the report is a ""code red for humanity"" and called for ""immediate action on energy.""""The alarm bells are deafening and the evidence is irrefutable: greenhouse‑gas emissions from fossil-fuel burning and deforestation are choking our planet and putting billions of people at immediate risk"" Guterres said in astatementearlier this month.

"Great white shark attacks are rare and when they do occur they are sometimes fatal. But attacks against the human species are often a result of mistaken identity new research published on Tuesday shows.Thestudy published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface was conducted by looking at humans and animals from a great white shark's eye view below the ocean surface. It's often been assumed that it's hard for sharks to differentiate between them but there is little research taking into account how sharks see rather than just from their perspective from underwater.Sharks according to the research have limited color perception if they are not completely color blind and have spatial resolving power that is ""considerably worse than humans."" So when they are looking for prey researchers found they more heavily rely on motion and brightness contrast.To determine how great white sharks primarily juveniles since they are most often the ones involved in human interactions might see objects when looking up from below the ocean surface researchers specifically compared video footage of rectangular floats humans swimming humans paddling surfboards and pinnipeds including sea lions and seals. The footage was filtered to mimic the sharks' visual system.And as it turns out the researchers found that juvenile great whites cannot significantly differentiate between the different life forms.

""It's a learning process that could be prone to mistakes.""The study was also conducted in a controlled pool setting rather than the ocean leading researchers to believe that the sharks' ability to differentiate between humans and prey is actually worse because of the lower visibility in oceans.

CBS News' Roxana Saberi sat down with Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen this week and asked him about the implications of any extension to President Biden's Afghanistan military withdrawal deadline and how the group intends to rule over the country.The wide-ranging interview touched on relations with the U.S. going forward how the Taliban intends to treat women and its stance on other extremist groups in Afghanistan.Below is a transcript of interview excerpts highlights of which can be seen in the video above. The transcript has been edited for clarity.U.S. withdrawal deadlineRoxana Saberi: You say there would be consequences if U.S. troops remain in Afghanistan past August 31st… What consequences?Suhail Shaheen: It means he [Biden] has violated the commitment he has made [to the Taliban to withdraw troops by August 31 in exchange for the Taliban pledging to prevent terrorism]. So in light of that violation it is up to our leadership to decide what to do.Saberi: Do you think possibly the Taliban would stop cooperating with the U.S. at the airport or stop U.S. flights out of the country?Shaheen: I can't say a specific consequences.Rush to finish Afghanistan evacuations06:23Saberi: If they do request [a deadline extension] the answer will be... ?Shaheen: We want them to abide by 31st August so there is no justification for them.Saberi: But would the answer be no?Shaheen: It is up to our leadership that they will take their decision because the violation is there.Ongoing violence by TalibanSaberi: We have heard instances from people who have said that they have been in hiding because they get a knock on the door by Taliban fighters looking for them… A German journalist for Deutsche Welle said that one of his family members was shot and killed by a Taliban member.Shaheen:Idon't rule out that maybe a bandit or spoilers and even our opponents … who are working to discredit our policy… even if some of our foot soldiers were involved in such incident they will be also punished and tried.Inside the Taliban takeover of Kandahar08:01Saberi: Is there a disconnect between the [Taliban] rank and file and the leadership?Shaheen: We will check the reports and carry out the investigation. Then it is our policy if anyone is found behind this these incidents he is immediately prosecuted.Women's rightsSaberi: Will women be able to work as they like and to leave the home without a male family member?Shaheen: Yes. Right now they are doing this… The girls are going to schools and they are going to universities. They are going to jobs.Saberi: There are some reports that for example universities in Herat for women were closed or that women working in banks in Kandahar were told to go home. What about those instances?Shaheen: I don't know about Herat… I told you about the policy. The policy has not changed… They should follow the policy.Future uncertain for Afghan women12:20Saberi: As a woman in Afghanistan would I need to cover my hair? Cover my face?Shaheen: Not face.Saberi: Only hair?Shaheen: Yes.Saberi: And that would be enough?Shaheen: Yes that is enough. They are already working this way.Afghanistan as a terrorist safe-havenSaberi: What lengths would the Taliban go to keep groups like ISIS and al Qaeda from using the country as a safe-haven?Shaheen: We will not allow any group to use Afghanistan as a safe-haven.Saberi: What about al Qaeda?Shaheen: Any group any group yes.Concerns over terror threat at Kabul airport09:44Saberi: They won't be allowed to have training camps or to recruit?Shaheen: Yeah this includes all.U.S. relationsSaberi: Is America still the enemy for the Taliban or is it now a friend?Shaheen: If they follow with the Afghan people a policy of friendship they are welcome.

"Tokyo— Japan's Health Ministry has pulled about 1.63 million doses of the Modernacoronavirusvaccine out of use after 39 unused vials at eight vaccination sites were discovered to be contaminated with a still-unspecified substance. No safety issues have been reported. All of the suspect vials were manufactured in Spain.Moderna has been sent primarily to mass-vaccination centers in Japan such as universities and large companies and it was unclear how badly the incident might set backJapan's already-delayed inoculation campaign. More than 800 vaccination sites were affected.Touring a vaccination clinic in Tokyo's Sumida Ward on Thursday Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga told Japanese media that he'd ordered health officials to ""make safety our top priority"" in responding to the tainted vaccine issue. He offered assurances that the incident ""would not have a significant impact"" on the country's vaccination program which lags significantly behind those of other major industrialized nations.Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga (C) and his wife Mariko Suga meet with first lady Jill Biden (L) at the Akasaka State Guest House in Tokyo on July 22 2021 on the eve of Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.STR/JAPAN POOL/AFP via Getty ImagesSuga whose popularity has taken a beating over his handling of the pandemic stands for re-election to the ruling party presidency on September 29.

"Charlie Watts the self-effacing and unshakeableRolling Stonesdrummer who helped anchor one of rock's greatest rhythm sections and used his ""day job"" to support his enduring love of jazz has died according to his publicist. He was 80.Bernard Dohertysaid Tuesdaythat Watts ""passed away peacefully in a London hospital earlier today surrounded by his family.""""Charlie was a cherished husband father and grandfather and also as a member of The Rolling Stones one of the greatest drummers of his generation"" Doherty said.Watts had announced earlier this monthhe would not tourwith the Stones in 2021 because of an undefined health issue. When Watts turned 80 in June Jagger posted a birthday message and video montage of the drummer on Twitter.Happy 80th birthday Charlie! Love Mickpic.twitter.com/tlk8ea6oE3— Mick Jagger (@MickJagger)June 2 2021The quiet elegantly dressed Watts was often ranked with Keith Moon Ginger Baker and a handful of others as a premier rock drummer respected worldwide for his muscular swinging style as the Stones rose from their scruffy beginnings to international superstardom. He joined the band early in 1963 and remained over the next 60 years ranked just behind Mick Jagger and Keith Richards as the group's longest lasting and most essential member.Watts stayed on and largely held himself apart through the drug abuse creative clashes and ego wars that helped kill founding member Brian Jones drove bassist Bill Wyman and Jones' replacement Mick Taylor to quit and otherwise made being in the Stones the most exhausting of jobs.A classic Stones song like ""Brown Sugar"" and ""Start Me Up"" often began with a hard guitar riff from Richards with Watts following closely behind and Wyman as the bassist liked to say ""fattening the sound."" Watts' speed power and time keeping were never better showcased than during the concert documentary ""Shine a Light"" when director Martin Scorsese filmed ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" from where he drummed toward the back of the stage.File photo of Ronnie Wood (left) and Charlie Watts of the Rolling Stones during a concert at the Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh Scotland on September 6 2018.Jane Barlow / APThe Stones began Watts said ""as white blokes from England playing Black American music"" but quickly evolved their own distinctive sound. Watts was a jazz drummer in his early years and never lost his affinity for the music he first loved heading his own jazz band and taking on numerous other side projects.He had his eccentricities - Watts liked to collect cars even though he didn't drive and would simply sit in them in his garage. But he was a steadying influence on stage and off as the Stones defied all expectations by rocking well into their 70s decades longer than their old rivals the Beatles.Watts didn't care for flashy solos or attention of any kind but with Wyman and Richards forged some of rock's deepest grooves on ""Honky Tonk Women"" ""Brown Sugar"" and other songs. The drummer adapted well to everything from the disco of ""Miss You"" to the jazzy ""Can't You Hear Me Knocking"" and the dreamy ballad ""Moonlight Mile.""Jagger and Richards at times seemed to agree on little else besides their admiration of Watts both as a man and a musician. Richards called Watts ""the key"" and often joked that their affinity was so strong that on stage he'd sometimes try to rattle Watts by suddenly changing the beat - only to have Watts change it right back.He also had an impact on the Rolling Stones that extended beyond drumming. He worked with Jagger on the ever more spectacular stage designs for the group's tours. He also provided illustrations for the back cover of the acclaimed 1967 album ""Between the Buttons"" and inadvertently gave the record its title. When he asked Stones manager Andrew Oldham what the album would be called Oldham responded ""Between the buttons"" meaning undecided. Watts thought that ""Between the Buttons"" was the actual name and included it in his artwork.This November 11 1965 photo supplied by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum shows from left Brian Jones Charlie Watts and Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones on the NBC teen music show ""Hullabaloo"" in New York.AP/Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and MuseumTo the world he was a rock star. But Watts often said that the actual experience was draining and unpleasant and even frightening. ""Girls chasing you down the street screaming...horrible!... I hated it"" he told The Guardian newspaper in an interview. In another interview he described the drumming life as a ""cross between being an athlete and a total nervous wreck.""Watts found refuge from the rock life marrying Shirley Ann Shepherd in 1964 and having a daughter Seraphina soon after. While other famous rock marriages crumbled theirs held. Jagger and Richards could only envy their bandmate's indifference to stardom and relative contentment in his private life which included happily tending horses on a rural estate in Devon England.Author Philip Norman who has written extensively about the Rolling Stones said Watts lived ""in constant hope of being allowed to catch the next plane home."" On tour he made a point of drawing each hotel room he stayed in a way of marking time until he could return to his family. He said little about playing the same songs for more than 40 years as the Stones recycled their classics. But he did branch out far beyond ""Satisfaction"" and ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" by assembling and performing with jazz bands in the second half of his career.Paul McCartneyand Ringo Starr were among the notable musicians to reacts to Watts' death on social media with Starr writing:  ""God bless Charlie Watts we're going to miss you man peace and love to the family.""#Godbless Charlie Watts we’re going to miss you man peace and love to the family Ringo 😎✌️🌟❤️🌈🎶☮️pic.twitter.com/3tSFg7EMQG— #RingoStarr (@ringostarrmusic)August 24 2021Lenny Kravitz calledWatts ""the beat of The Stones"" while Elton John called him ""the ultimate drummer.""A very sad day. Charlie Watts was the ultimate drummer. The most stylish of men and such brilliant company. My deepest condolences to Shirley Seraphina and Charlotte. And of course The Rolling Stones.@therollingstones#CharlieWatts#RIPpic.twitter.com/9rjSSgioZL— Elton John (@eltonofficial)August 24 2021Charles Robert Watts son of a lorry driver and a housewife was born in Neasden London on June 2 1941. From childhood he was passionate about music - jazz in particular. He fell in love with the drums after hearing Chico Hamilton and taught himself to play by listening to records by Johnny Dodds Charlie Parker Duke Ellington and other jazz giants.He worked for a London advertising firm after he attended Harrow Art College and played drums in his spare time. London was home to a blues and jazz revival in the early 1960s with Jagger Richards and Eric Clapton among the future superstars getting their start. Watts' career took off after he played with Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated for whom Jagger also performed and was encouraged by Korner to join the Stones.Watts wasn't a rock music fan at first and remembered being guided by Richards and Brian Jones as he absorbed blues and rock records notably the music of bluesman Jimmy Reed. He said the band could trace its roots to a brief period when he had lost his job and shared an apartment with Jagger and Richards because he could live there rent-free.""Keith Richards taught me rock and roll"" Watts said. ""We'd have nothing to do all day and we'd play these records over and over again. I learned to love Muddy Waters. Keith turned me on to how good Elvis Presley was and I'd always hated Elvis up 'til then.""Watts was the final man to join the Stones; the band had searched for months to find a permanent drummer and feared Watts was too accomplished for them. Richards recalled the band wanting him so badly to join that members cut down on expenses so they could afford to pay Watts a proper salary. Watts said he believed at first the band would be lucky to last a year.""Every band I'd ever been in had lasted a week"" he said. ""I always thought the Stones would last a week then a fortnight and then suddenly it's 30 years.""For much of his career Watts resisted the excesses of his bandmates but he fell into heroin addiction in the mid-1980s. He would credit his stable relationship with his wife for getting him off drugs.""I was warring with myself at that time"" he told Rolling Stone magazine.With his financial future secure because of the Stones' status as one of the world's most popular live bands Watts was able to indulge his passion for jazz by putting together some of the most talented musicians in Britain for a series of recordings and performances. They typically played during the long breaks between Stones tours.His first jazz record the 1986 ""Live at Fulham Town Hall"" was recorded by the Charlie Watts Orchestra. Others by the Charlie Watts Quintet followed and he expanded that group into the Charlie Watts and the Tentet.Watts was an acclaimed jazz bandleader when he wasstricken with throat cancer in 2004. He received extensive treatment and made a full recovery. His return to health allowed him to resume touring with both the Stones and his jazz band.By then the young man who had worn his brown hair down to his shoulders in the late 1960s had evolved into a craggy white-haired impeccably dressed senior statesman of rock. Getting Watts to talk about his place in rock history was almost impossible but he seemed to enjoy talking about fashion. It was not unusual to see him attired in a custom-made suit and polka dot tie while his bandmates wore jeans and T-shirts.In the tumultuous extremely competitive world of rock and roll Watts seemed to make few enemies.""It all seems to boil down to a certain quality which is as rare as hen's teeth in the music business but which Charlie Watts is perceived to have in abundance. In a word decency"" columnist Barbara Ellen wrote after interviewing Watts in 2000. ""You've got to hand it to a...man who's played with the world's most influential rock 'n' roll band...and stayed happily married to his wife Shirley....A man who moreover remains resolutely determined not to take his elevated position too seriously.""The Rolling Stones through the ages66 photosMusicMoreJ Balvin apologizes after music video sparks backlash: ""That's not who I am""Saturday Sessions: Houndmouth performs ""Good For You""Ronnie Tutt drummer for Elvis Presley and more has died at 83Paul McCartney says John Lennon was behind Beatles' breakup not himOlivia Rodrigo on ""Sour"" and the artistry of heartbreakMoreDownload our Free AppFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News appiOSAndroidFire TVApple TVRokuAll Smart TV Apps";Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts dies at age 80;https://www.cbsnews.com;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/charlie-watts-rolling-stones-drummer-dies-age-80/;mindset;0.930000

"Great white shark attacks are rare and when they do occur they are sometimes fatal. But attacks against the human species are often a result of mistaken identity new research published on Tuesday shows.Thestudy published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface was conducted by looking at humans and animals from a great white shark's eye view below the ocean surface. It's often been assumed that it's hard for sharks to differentiate between them but there is little research taking into account how sharks see rather than just from their perspective from underwater.Sharks according to the research have limited color perception if they are not completely color blind and have spatial resolving power that is ""considerably worse than humans."" So when they are looking for prey researchers found they more heavily rely on motion and brightness contrast.To determine how great white sharks primarily juveniles since they are most often the ones involved in human interactions might see objects when looking up from below the ocean surface researchers specifically compared video footage of rectangular floats humans swimming humans paddling surfboards and pinnipeds including sea lions and seals. The footage was filtered to mimic the sharks' visual system.And as it turns out the researchers found that juvenile great whites cannot significantly differentiate between the different life forms. The silhouettes of the different objects at the surface are too similar for the animals given their reliance on motion and light.""From the perspective of a white shark...neither visual motion nor shape cues allow an unequivocal visual distinction between pinnipeds and humans"" the study says ""supporting the mistaken identity theory behind some bites.""Laura Ryan the lead author of the study said in apress releasefrom Macquarie University that surfers are the most at-risk for fatal shark bites particularly from juveniles.""We found that surfers swimmers and pinnipeds (seals and sea lions) on the surface of the ocean will look the same to a white shark looking up from below because these sharks can't see fine details or colours"" she said.Professor Nathan Hart senior author of the study said thatgreat whiteshave to learn what to eat and their diet changes as they grow and learn. This could explain why juvenile sharks tend to be more commonly involved in biting humans. Adult sharks researchers said tend to have better vision and can better differentiate.""They need to develop a search image for these prey items and combine that with other sensory information"" Hart said. ""It's a learning process that could be prone to mistakes.""The study was also conducted in a controlled pool setting rather than the ocean leading researchers to believe that the sharks' ability to differentiate between humans and prey is actually worse because of the lower visibility in oceans. They also believe that the mistaken identity theory could apply to other shark species associated with human fatalities such as tiger sharks or bull sharks.But researchers also urged people to remember that shark bites are rare. In 2020 there were 57 confirmed unprovokedshark attack casesworldwide according to the University of Florida's International Shark Attack File. The 2015 to 2019 average was 80 incidents every year.They also reiterated that sharks themselves are endangered. In January scientists announced that shark and ray populations havedeclined more than 70%over the past 50 years with overfishing being a main culprit. Fish nets and drum lines often placed under water to ward off the animals only further threaten the species and other marine life researchers of the great white study found.They hope their findings can help find better ways to prevent future shark bites and provide an overall better understanding of the creatures that are vital to marine ecosystems.""Understanding why shark bites occur can help us find ways to prevent them"" Ryan said ""while keeping both humans and sharks safer.""Direction and strength of motion cues from the 2DMD model of (a–c) a pinniped swimming (d–f) a human paddling a surfboard (g–i) a human swimming and (j–l) a rectangular float towed through the water. Modelling was performed assuming a spatial resolving power of either 5 cpd (behk) or 2.5 cpd (cfil). Red open dots indicate angle vectors that were significantly different from the pinniped and black dots were not significantly different. Units are an arbitrary scaling value.

The queenspent a night in the hospitallast week to undergo preliminary checks according to the Palace — her first overnight stay in eight years.""Her Majesty is disappointed not to attend the Reception but will deliver a message to the assembled delegates via a recorded video message"" Buckingham Palace said in a statement.The 95-year-old queen resumed official engagements on Tuesday carrying out virtual events from Windsor Castle. She is limiting herself to light duties however canceling a recent planned trip to Northern Ireland. In recent weeks she has been seen using a walking stick. Her hospital stay was only confirmed by the Palace after being reported by the tabloid press.The Prince of Wales as well as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are still scheduled to attend the Glasgow climate summit.The Press Association news agency reported it was hoped that world leaders would not use the queen's absence as an excuse not to attend the conference. She had previously been picked up on video appearing to express irritation at the global lack of action on climate change.""I've been hearing all about COP... still don't know who is coming... no idea"" she appeared to say in a video showing her speaking with Camilla the Duchess of Cornwall. ""We only know about people who are not coming... It's really irritating when they talk but they don't do.""On Tuesday the queen virtually received the Korean ambassador to the U.K. Gunn Kim and the Swiss ambassador to the U.K. Markus Leitner. Royal commentators have been happy to see the queen resume official duties.""It is encouraging because she hasn't been seen publicly for a week and now we're seeing her back at work"" said Joe Little managing editor of Majesty magazine according to the Press Association.

"Great white shark attacks are rare and when they do occur they are sometimes fatal. But attacks against the human species are often a result of mistaken identity new research published on Tuesday shows.Thestudy published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface was conducted by looking at humans and animals from a great white shark's eye view below the ocean surface. It's often been assumed that it's hard for sharks to differentiate between them but there is little research taking into account how sharks see rather than just from their perspective from underwater.Sharks according to the research have limited color perception if they are not completely color blind and have spatial resolving power that is ""considerably worse than humans."" So when they are looking for prey researchers found they more heavily rely on motion and brightness contrast.To determine how great white sharks primarily juveniles since they are most often the ones involved in human interactions might see objects when looking up from below the ocean surface researchers specifically compared video footage of rectangular floats humans swimming humans paddling surfboards and pinnipeds including sea lions and seals. The footage was filtered to mimic the sharks' visual system.And as it turns out the researchers found that juvenile great whites cannot significantly differentiate between the different life forms. The silhouettes of the different objects at the surface are too similar for the animals given their reliance on motion and light.""From the perspective of a white shark...neither visual motion nor shape cues allow an unequivocal visual distinction between pinnipeds and humans"" the study says ""supporting the mistaken identity theory behind some bites.""Laura Ryan the lead author of the study said in apress releasefrom Macquarie University that surfers are the most at-risk for fatal shark bites particularly from juveniles.""We found that surfers swimmers and pinnipeds (seals and sea lions) on the surface of the ocean will look the same to a white shark looking up from below because these sharks can't see fine details or colours"" she said.Professor Nathan Hart senior author of the study said thatgreat whiteshave to learn what to eat and their diet changes as they grow and learn. This could explain why juvenile sharks tend to be more commonly involved in biting humans. Adult sharks researchers said tend to have better vision and can better differentiate.""They need to develop a search image for these prey items and combine that with other sensory information"" Hart said. ""It's a learning process that could be prone to mistakes.""The study was also conducted in a controlled pool setting rather than the ocean leading researchers to believe that the sharks' ability to differentiate between humans and prey is actually worse because of the lower visibility in oceans. They also believe that the mistaken identity theory could apply to other shark species associated with human fatalities such as tiger sharks or bull sharks.But researchers also urged people to remember that shark bites are rare. In 2020 there were 57 confirmed unprovokedshark attack casesworldwide according to the University of Florida's International Shark Attack File. The 2015 to 2019 average was 80 incidents every year.They also reiterated that sharks themselves are endangered. In January scientists announced that shark and ray populations havedeclined more than 70%over the past 50 years with overfishing being a main culprit. Fish nets and drum lines often placed under water to ward off the animals only further threaten the species and other marine life researchers of the great white study found.They hope their findings can help find better ways to prevent future shark bites and provide an overall better understanding of the creatures that are vital to marine ecosystems.""Understanding why shark bites occur can help us find ways to prevent them"" Ryan said ""while keeping both humans and sharks safer.""Direction and strength of motion cues from the 2DMD model of (a–c) a pinniped swimming (d–f) a human paddling a surfboard (g–i) a human swimming and (j–l) a rectangular float towed through the water.
